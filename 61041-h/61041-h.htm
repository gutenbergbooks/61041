<h2>PREFACE.</h2>

<p>Two facts, at least, should be remembered by the
readers of this book.</p>

<p>1. It was not uncommon in the times of the Christ
for Hebrew men, in imitation of Joseph and Moses and
Boaz, to marry outside of their own people.</p>

<p>2. It is a great mistake to suppose that women in the
Roman Empire of the First Century were secluded after
the current oriental fashion. They had about as much
freedom on most lines of social intercourse as women have
among us. The New Testament shows this in regard to
Palestine and such contiguous countries as appear in the
Acts of the Apostles. But it was the same wherever the
Roman authority and influence extended.</p>

<p>“Tradition was in favor of restriction, but by a concurrence
of circumstances women had been liberated
from the enslaving fetters of the old legal forms, and enjoyed
freedom of intercourse in society; they walked and
drove in the public thoroughfares with veils that did not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_ii" id="Page_ii">[ii]</a></span>
conceal their faces; they dined in the company of men;
they studied literature and philosophy; they took part
in political movements; they were allowed to defend
their own law cases if they liked; and they helped their
husbands in the government of provinces and the writing
of books.”</p>

<h3>I.<br />
<span class="smaller">DOWN THE NILE.</span></h3>

<p>From Coptus downward on the dreamy Nile—past
innumerable canals with their primitive water-wheels;
past populous villages and lordly villas embowered
in sycamores and palms; past still more lordly
ruins, silent now for many a century; past caravans and
pleasure-parties and bodies of Roman soldiery, foot and
horse, coming and going on the thoroughfares that closely
skirt the river on either hand; past water craft of all
sorts, from skin-buoyed rafts carrying sandstone from
Chennu to the Delta up to gay barges carrying travelers
to Thebes and the dead Egypt of the Pharaohs; past
crocodiles and hippopotami and pelicans sporting in the
water, or basking along the muddy shore as so many logs
or stones.</p>

<p><em>Who</em> are moving downward on the dreamy Nile to
Alexandria—in a large merchant vessel, whose lateen sail
swells gently to the south wind? A large number of persons
with whom we have no special concern. Two persons
with whom we have great concern, and whose appearance
is striking enough to draw much attention from
their fellow-travelers, as they stand together watching the
ever-changing scene.</p>

<p>Both wear the classic Greek dress, of plain material.
The elder, a man of some sixty years, is so Greek in feature<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[6]</a></span>
that no dress is needed to proclaim his nationality.
The other, a young man of perhaps twenty years, has a
face of a different type. And what a face! Is it Egyptian?
No. Is it Roman? No. Is it Hebrew? No.
As we take our privilege of drawing very near, and of
looking carefully at those features on all sides, and even
of lifting the abundant brown hair from the broad white
forehead that swells so loftily over the steady and somewhat
austere gray eyes, we would rather say that we are
looking on the original type from which all other racial
faces have varied, so readily does it express the better elements
of all. Yes, the young man must be from Britain
or the Caucasus—and yet he certainly is not from Britain;
for that is still a land of savages, and this youth has an
air of culture and refinement, which the plainness of his
garb cannot conceal. Is it mere fancy? Have I really a
sixth sense? There is something about the young man
that seems to breathe of lofty plateaus, and mountain
summits, and torrents that dash and roar on their way
from the clouds to the sea. What does this mountaineer
here among the lowlands of the Nile?</p>

<p>He is evidently looking at the country for the first
time. Everything seems to interest him much. His
companion, as plainly, is by no means an entire stranger
to the scene, and yet shows the degree of interest natural
to one who is revisiting a country after long absence.
The Greek language flows easily between the two; as the
elder from time to time points this way and that, and
seems to be recalling and introducing old acquaintances,
as the vessel slowly glides by object after object.</p>

<p>“It is now more than thirty years,” said the Greek,
whom we will call Cimon, “since I left Egypt; but I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[7]</a></span>
notice very few changes—here and there a new quay or
villa, or an old palace decorated with new gardens and
trees. I once knew who lived in some of the finer dwellings;
for example, yonder low castellated building that
covers so much ground on the eastern bank. It is very
ancient, and the gradual rise of the land from the annual
deposits by the river, long since converted the lower story
into a dungeon. The Roman proprætor lived here a part
of the year. It once belonged to Cleopatra; was given
by her to a favorite noble and relative, from whom the
Romans took it, as being heirs to all the Pharaohs.”</p>

<p>The vessel, from some cause, now approached the
palace they were observing, and the two men walked to
the right side of the boat for a closer view. While standing
here and noticing various points of a structure that
was now seen to be a fortress as well as a palace, they became
aware of a man standing by their side.</p>

<p>“You seem interested in this place,” he said in a
grave but courteous tone; “can I give you any information
about it? I happen to be particularly well acquainted
in this neighborhood.”</p>

<p>They had turned to see a man of majestic stature and
mien, far advanced in life, but still erect as a palm and
keen-eyed—as thoroughly Egyptian in his look and dress
as Rameses the Great.</p>

<p>“I see that you are strangers, and <em>not</em> Romans,” he
added apologetically, “and old age likes to speak of the
past when it can do so safely.” And he looked around as
if to assure himself that they were alone.</p>

<p>Cimon politely thanked the Egyptian, and said that he
had just been telling his young friend Aleph that the
structure before them was once a royal residence.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[8]</a></span></p>

<p>“That is so,” said the old man; “not only a residence
of the Ptolemies, but also of our native kings.
You see that the material is stone from Syene, and that
the style of building is old Egyptian. It passed to the
Ptolemies with the crown of the Pharaohs, but was restored
to a direct descendant of the old owners as an act
of justice by Cleopatra. For a generation it continued
in his family; but at last the Roman governor took a liking
to the place and took it. The Romans are apt to
take what they like.”</p>

<p>“Not a very uncommon thing for conquerors anywhere
to do,” said Cimon. “Perhaps the site of this
very palace was taken without purchase or leave by the
Pharaoh who built it, from a weak subject or from another
defeated Pharaoh.”</p>

<p>“I think not,” decidedly said the Egyptian. “I
could show you papyri and parchments in the Serapeum
proving that the property has been in the possession of
the same priestly family to which it now belongs almost
as long as we have been historically a people; and that,
you know, is a great while, and nearly connects us with
the time when vacant Misraim was divided among our
fathers.”</p>

<p>“Certainly,” said the young man whom we have heard
his companion call Aleph, “no people between this and
the Pillars of Hercules holds its land by so ancient and
original a tenure as does the people of Misraim. The
Egyptian is older than the Roman, older than the Greek;
indeed, was wise and powerful ages before Rome or Greece
was born. And, if I mistake not, there is no tradition,
nor other reason for thinking, that your fathers dispossessed
any other people. They must stand as original<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[9]</a></span>
proprietors. If immemorial possession, without hint of
wrong, does not give a just title, the world knows of no such
title, whether the party be a nation or an individual.”</p>

<p>“That seems to me well said,” came slowly from the
old man, as his eye rested on the ingenuous face of the
youth. “We came to the valley of the Nile so early that
we did not have to inhabit at the expense of any other
nation. We may be said to hold our country directly from
the immortal gods.”</p>

<p>“You say we <em>came</em>,” said Cimon. “So, in your
opinion, this was not the original site of the Egyptians.
From whence do you suppose them to have come, and at
how early a period? For my part, I have no doubt that
you were here, and were here as a great and accomplished
people, long before the Greeks, or even the Phenicians,
had any political existence.”</p>

<p>“Your question would be variously answered among
us,” returned the Egyptian. “Some would claim for our
past hundreds of thousands, and even millions, of years;
would say that such a civilization as ours was at the date
of our oldest monuments could not have ripened from
that savagery and even brutality which they fancy to have
been the primitive human condition in anything short of
such immense periods. But such is not my view. I see
that you are surprised at this!”</p>

<p>“Not surprised that you reject the brute-origin of
mankind,” returned the Greek; “for that seems to be
contrary to the feeling and faith of all nations; but rather
surprised that you do not share what I have supposed to
be the fashionable opinion among Egyptians as to their
immense antiquity, and what would naturally be to you a
very pleasant opinion.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span></p>

<p>“No opinion is pleasant to me,” replied the old man,
slowly shaking his head, “for which I can see no reasonable
foundation. Manetho, our only extant historian,
was an ancestor of mine. I have his original manuscripts,
entire, and am satisfied by the careful study of them and
of the palace registers of Thebes that his earlier dynasties
were largely cotemporaneous. No; from two thousand
to three thousand years are enough to account for our
whole history, monuments and all, if we suppose the
nation to have been originally gifted and far advanced in
civilization on their coming into the land.”</p>

<p>“May I ask from whence you suppose them to have
come?” inquired Aleph.</p>

<p>“That is a very broad question at its broadest; and
the broadest is what I see in the depths of your eyes.
There has been but one tradition among us on the subject,
and it is like the traditions of all these western peoples.
They look toward the sun-rising. Our fathers entered
the land from the north, after journeying from the
east. From what part of the great east, do you say? My
answer is that Seti the aged is the son of the youth who
now stands before me. His is the primitive stock. Caucasian
Chaldea is the cradle of the nations. And if you
go on to ask whence that cradle and primitive stock, I
have to tell you what primitive Egypt thought and said—that
<span class="smcap">Amun Re</span>, the eternal, almighty, and all-wise Spirit,
made the stars and the world, and the first parents of us
all. That your Democritus and Epicurus,” added the
Egyptian, looking archly at Cimon, “should have taught
differently! They should have visited us three thousand
years ago and taken lessons. They would have steered
their way more successfully among the snags and breakers<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[11]</a></span>
of thought. For, the stream of history is like the Nile—broad
with us, and not without its monsters as well as
fertilities, but beginning small and beginning very high
among mysterious mountains. I speak with confidence;
for I feel that, owing to certain circumstances, I stand on
higher ground than most observers do, and can see farther
across the centuries. The horizon is distant, but I can
see that there <em>is</em> a horizon, and that it sweeps high among
the clouds.”</p>

<p class="tb">At this moment a Roman officer, who had been lying
intoxicated behind some boxes, but was now sufficiently
recovered to be miserable and quarrelsome, came somewhat
unsteadily toward them. They were standing with
their backs toward him; and, noticing their plain garbs,
he was, perhaps, encouraged in his thought of mischief.
Coming up to the Egyptian, he struck him a smart blow
on the back with the flat of his sheathed sword which he
carried in his hand.</p>

<p>“Ha, old mummy, did you never see a Roman before?”
as Seti turned suddenly toward him. “Improve
your opportunity. But you will have an opportunity to
<em>feel</em> a Roman as well as to see him if you do not at once
find the skipper for me. Come, hurry off, old fellow!”
and he raised his sword as if for another blow.</p>

<p>Aleph stepped between. “It is more fitting that I
should do your errand, if it must be done. You see that
I am a young man,” said he, fixing a steady eye on the
haughty and inflamed face before him.</p>

<p>“Who are you who dare to stand between a Roman
and his will?” cried the officer furiously, his hand still
uplifted.</p>

<p>“Let it suffice you that we are peaceable people, moving<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span>
quietly about on our own private affairs, as Roman law
and custom entitle us to do. Do you understand?”</p>

<p>“I understand that if you do not stand away from between
Rome and Egypt, the Caucasus will suffer,” and
the madman began to draw his sword.</p>

<p>“Listen,” said Aleph with composure and emphasis.
“You had better not. You have a superior officer, and
we are going to Alexandria. I call all these people to
witness (by this time many had gathered about) that this
quarrel is not of our seeking.”</p>

<p>“Dare you threaten a Roman commander, you beardless
cub! By the immortals, you shall see what I dare,”
shouted the man, as he plucked his sword from the scabbard.</p>

<p>“You <em>shall</em> not,” said Aleph; and, snatching a large
bundle from a by-stander, he thrust it into the face of the
Roman. It burst and enveloped the man in a cloud of
pelican feathers, which a Jew had been collecting for the
rag-market of Alexandria. Before his assailant could recover
himself and sight, Aleph had thrown his arms about
him, secured his sword, and, despite his struggles, laid
him supine on the floor. Then, without much difficulty,
he managed to swathe and bind his arms to his body with
his long sword-sash. Looking about, his eye caught a
small coil of rope near him; this he drew to himself, and
with it fastened the man in a sitting posture to one of the
posts that supported the awning. All this was not done
without much struggling and cursing on the part of the
Roman; but Aleph was perfectly silent till his prisoner
was well secured. Then, turning to the spectators, he
said:</p>

<p>“In behalf of the general safety, let this man remain<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]</a></span>
as you see him till we reach Alexandria. Wine has made
him dangerous; and you notice that what has been done,
I only have done, and that reluctantly, to prevent something
worse.”</p>

<p>A cheer flashed out from the faces huddled about, and
almost shaped itself on their parted lips, but was suddenly
suppressed before anything more than an indistinct murmur
had escaped; for their eyes fell on the watchful and
infuriated face of the officer. They were prudent people,
those passengers. They admired courage; they were glad
to see a Roman put down; but they were not ready to
sacrifice safety to sentiment. So, instead of cheering, they
compromised and fell to laughing at the Jew, who, exclaiming,
“O, my feathers, my poor feathers! Ah, father
Abraham, I am a ruined man this day; what will become
of me!” crept about on his hands and knees, trying to
collect as much of his volatile property as possible.</p>

<p>“Do not worry yourself, my friend,” said Seti to him
in a low voice; “gather what you can, and add this coin
to make the weight good. What has been lost for my
sake shall not be loss to you.”</p>

<p>The Jew glanced at the coin that had been slipped
into his hand, and, catching the gleam of gold, hurried
it dexterously to his pouch, at the same time exclaiming,
“May all the patriarchs ... oh, my beautiful feathers
for which I paid ... may Abraham, Isaac, and
Jacob ... ah, what will become of me!”</p>

<p>And so he went on groping and exclaiming and stuffing
handful after handful of his recovered property into
his bag amid the merriment of the crowd.</p>

<p>Making a sign to the two friends to follow, the Egyptian<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span>
led the way to another part of the vessel free from
people, where was a single seat. On this he seated himself.</p>

<p>“I take the privilege of age,” said he, “and I am by
no means sure but that age gives me the only advantage I
have over you. I suspect that the eyes of Seti, though
aged, have made a discovery.”</p>

<p>The two friends glanced inquiringly at each other, but
said nothing. They were now moving along the canal
that connected the Nile with Lake Mareotis; and for
some time they silently watched the agricultural operations
and the ever-increasing number of people and dwellings
on either bank. At length, emerging into the lake,
they saw in the distance the crowded shipping and towers
of the city of Alexandria.</p>

<p>Seti roused himself from the mood of intense thoughtfulness,
into which he had fallen, and asked:</p>

<p>“Are you acquainted with Alexandria?”</p>

<p>Cimon answered: “With the city, well; with the
people of the city, not at all. A generation has passed
since I was here.”</p>

<p>“Excuse one further question,” continued the Egyptian.
“Do you stay long in the city?”</p>

<p>“That depends on circumstances,” replied Cimon;
“but probably our affairs will keep us here for some
time.”</p>

<p>“This young man has to-day made an enemy, and
a powerful one; no less a person than the dissipated son
of Flaccus, the Governor of Egypt. But he has also
found a friend; and if at any time you should need such
aid, in whatever affairs you have in hand, as can be given
by a native of the country, and by one well acquainted<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span>
with things and persons here and not altogether without
influence, ask at the Serapeum for the priest Seti, and
you will find that I have not forgotten to-day. Do you
believe in faces?” looking at Aleph.</p>

<p>“In <em>some</em> faces, as interpreted by circumstances, I do
certainly,” replied the young man.</p>

<p>“And so do I, at least so far as you are concerned,”
said the Egyptian; “and it is largely because I do so that
I now say what I do. There are two men in Alexandria
with whom you should have as little dealing as possible.
One is Flaccus, the Roman; the other is Malus, the Jew.
The one is violent, the other is crafty, and both are
wicked and powerful. Avoid them, if possible; but if it
is not possible, then remember Seti, the Egyptian. It is
true—what the proverb says, that in this world the worst
men often occupy the best places.”</p>

<p>As the vessel approached the quay, Seti continued:
“I think that, contrary to my expectation, I will ask one
more question before we part. Of what faith are you?
All sorts are found here; also multitudes with no faith at
all. Where do you stand?” looking at Cimon. “Do
you hold with your fathers?”</p>

<p>“With my father,” said the Greek; “but not with
my fathers. I follow not Zeus, but Jehovah; not the
oracles of Delphi and Dodona, but those of the Hebrew
prophets. This young man the same.”</p>

<p>“It is as I supposed,” said the old man, after a moment
adding, as if to himself, “and it is well. Zeus,
Jupiter, Amun Re, and Jehovah, rightly understood, are
the same.”</p>

<p>Giving them his hand, he stepped ashore, and disappeared
in the crowd. Runners from the various khans<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span>
now came noisily aboard and fought for customers, as
they do now, and have done from time out of mind. To
one of these troublesome fellows Cimon delivered certain
packages, and then, with his young companion, followed
them. In passing the spot where they had left the
Roman, they found that he had disappeared. Who had
set him free? No matter; he is gone. We hope they
have seen the last of him. We hope that returning soberness
has made the man so ashamed of himself that hereafter
he will carefully keep out of view. But we have
our fears. The appeal from Philip drunk to Philip sober
is not always a success. Besides, Philip was not a
Roman.</p>

<h3>II.<br />
<span class="smaller">THE CARAVANSARY.</span></h3>

<p>The khan to which our two friends were conducted
was not far from the landing. It was the chief
point, in that part of the city, of arrival and departure
for commercial people; and, as evening was now near,
the great court within was bustling and picturesque with
arrivals. Donkeys were being led through it to stables
in the rear, camels were being unloaded, horsemen were
dismounting; it was a very Babel of sounds, of costumes,
and of movements.</p>

<p>“Is Nathan still the keeper of this khan?” inquired
Cimon of their guide, as they were being shown to their
quarters.</p>

<p>“He is,” said the man; “but he is now out of the
city. Do you wish to see his assistant? The master
himself will not be at home for, perhaps, some days.”</p>

<p>Cimon answered in the negative. Following their
guide and parcels into a small sleeping-room, with an
ante-room opening on the piazza which surrounded the
court, and directing that a simple meal should be sent to
them in the evening, they busied themselves for a while
in arranging matters for the night. Then they went out
on the cooler piazza, and seated themselves on a bench.</p>

<p>“This adventure with the Roman seems unfortunate,”<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span>
said Cimon thoughtfully. “Unless matters have much
changed since I was here, the ill-will of any Roman official
is not to be coveted; while that of the Roman governor
looks like quite a serious matter to people on such an
errand as ours.”</p>

<p>“My interference, I suppose,” said Aleph, “would
hardly be considered prudent by most people; but I cannot
but think that there is something better than prudence.
Shall we never allow our hearts to speak and act
without stopping to consider how our interests will be
affected? Safety gained in that way seems to me hardly
worth the having.”</p>

<p>“I think you are right,” said the other. “I am far
from finding fault with what you have done. Under like
circumstances I would have you do it again. Our first
thought, no doubt, should be, What is highest and worthiest?
If that is not prudence, it is something vastly better.
But it <em>is</em> prudence, on the whole; for it will never
do for a man to despise himself and offend Heaven. God
governs. But we must wait for Him. A cloud is not
always a calamity. A rough wind may help one toward
the harbor sought. I know that these are your father’s
views, and that he would be unwilling to have his son
sacrifice, even magnanimity to any appearance of present
advantage.”</p>

<p>“Have you any idea who Seti is?” inquired the
young man after a moment.</p>

<p>“I have been trying,” answered the other, “to find
in my memory something about him. I know that when
I was here, the Egyptians as well as the Jews had an
official head or <i>alabarch</i> of their own nation, who was
the organ of communication between them and the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[21]</a></span>
Roman authorities. My impression is that the Egyptian
alabarch was of Pharaonic family and a priest of the Serapeum.
It may be that Seti is the man. I hope he is.”</p>

<p>“I confess,” said Aleph, “that the man has quite
taken possession of me. It seems to me that I would be
willing to venture almost anything on his thorough uprightness
and even grandeur of character, although I
have known him but such a short time. Did you notice
what an aspect he turned on the Roman just after the
blow? Had not the fellow been besotted, the surprised
majesty of that look alone would have quelled him. But
how is it possible for such a man to be a worshipper of
brutes, and even to act as their priest?”</p>

<p>“That is not a question easily answered,” replied the
Greek. “But probably Seti, like all superior Egyptian
priests from time immemorial, believes in a religion for
the few and another religion for the many. The doctrine
of One God to be worshiped without sensible figures is
for the few elect who are prepared for it; the lower
classes in general are not prepared for it, but need to
have the various divine attributes shadowed out to them
in sensible forms; and as no forms that man can make
are equal to even the familiar living creatures with their
wonderful mysteries of internal structure, these are offered
to assist the feeble thought of feeble men. Of course, this
is all wrong; but it is a wrong imbedded in the traditions
and prejudices of ages, and so not easily escaped from.
Jehovah makes allowances for such people, whether their
names be Socrates and Plato or Zoroaster and Seti. Aristotle
says that some of our species have gold blended in
their composition from the very beginning. Seti seems
to me one of these.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span></p>

<p>By this time the sun was below the west side of the
khan, and the open court was quite in the shade. This
brought out into it and the surrounding piazzas all the
guests. It was a motley to see as well as to hear. Almost
every nation seemed represented, almost every style of
features and costume. There were Romans, Greeks,
Phenicians, Egyptians, Persians, Arabs, and even a
sprinkling of natives from Gaul, Spain, and other places.
Such a variety of faces, dress, and, when one listened attentively,
of speech! A drag-net of all seas was Nathan’s
khan.</p>

<p>Aleph was all eyes and ears. The scene was full of
novelty and interest to him. At length, turning to his
companion, he said:</p>

<p>“This scene reminds me of what I have often heard
you and my father say.”</p>

<p>“And what is that?” asked Cimon. “Your father,
at least, is wont to say wise things beyond any man I ever
knew.”</p>

<p>“That, wide as is the variety of religious beliefs
among men, they believe alike in certain main respects.
What differences among the faces before us as to color,
size, proportion of parts, expression; and yet they are all
faces, all human faces, all faces having the same general
plan of structure and location of the various organs.”</p>

<p>“Yes,” added the elder; “<i lang="la">Homines diversi sed
homines</i>, as said a Roman before you. And see how
various the costume; and yet it is all clothing,—all clothing
that recognizes the warm climate, the season of the
year, and to a certain extent the time of day and the convenience
of travelers.”</p>

<p>“And you might add,” continued the young man,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span>
after a moment of close listening, “that it is just so with
the various articulate sounds that come to us. While
they differ in tone, in time, in syntax, in dialect, they
are all speech, all articulate speech, and, for the most
part, speech so much of the Greek pattern as to be intelligible
to nearly all of us.”</p>

<p>“Yes,” said Cimon, “and I suppose that it is very
much so with the religious beliefs of these people.
Though their creeds differ much among themselves, they
are alike in many most important particulars. They all
recognize a realm of spiritual beings superior to man, a
Supreme Deity, his concern in human affairs, messages
from him, our responsibility to him, a future state of rewards
and punishments, and the main principles of good
morals. There may be some exceptions; for these, I understand,
are skeptical times in the Roman world. Almost
everything is called in question among the philosophers,
even the fact that there is something to be called in
question; though it is found hard to get men to question
that the Romans are masters, that Tiberius reigns, and
that Alexandria is the greatest emporium of the world.
But the vagaries of the schools make but little impression
on the people at large. They never have done so. The
more fundamental beliefs have kept a firm hold on all
nations and ages. A little pool will show the heavens as
well as the ocean. This khan is a little pool; and at the
bottom of it, amid many wrinkles and clouds, one can
discover many of the larger stars of religious truth which
have shone on the world from the beginning.”</p>

<p>“And how do you account for these universal beliefs?”
asked Aleph.</p>

<p>“It seems to me that they came from a Divine revelation<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span>
to the first fathers of the race, and that they were
carried forth with them as they gradually dispersed from
their original seats, and that they took root so deeply in
the needs and reasons of men that no evil circumstances
have been able to remove them. It seems to me that as
all the routes of trade in our day naturally converge on
Alexandria, so the natural highways of thought and need
all over the world converge on these fundamental truths.”</p>

<p>“No doubt you also think it reasonable to believe
that Deity, who made the deposits with the race, has
been personally active all along to preserve it, as a broad
ground for responsibility and further enlightenment?
In addition to a mighty undertow in human nature itself
toward these fundamental truths, there are winds and currents
of external circumstance setting in the same direction
by the personal agency of the Most High.”</p>

<p>“Just so. But look at those men!”</p>

<p>The two persons pointed at had been sitting not far
away in the open court, conversing in a low tone. By
degrees their conversation had become more animated and
loud, until now they were earnestly gesturing and talking
so as to be distinctly understood at a distance. It seemed
that one of the disputants was a Phenician, and was endeavoring
to settle an account of long standing with an
Alexandrian dealer in Tyrian dyes, to whom these goods
had from time to time been consigned. This dealer
claimed that several of the consignments had been short
in both quantity and quality; and so offered about half
the regular price for the whole lot.</p>

<p>The other protested, called Baal and Ashtaroth to witness
that his claim was just; said that he had trusted for
so long and for so much, that if his accounts were not now<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a></span>
allowed, he would be ruined. He had arrived from Sidon
some days before, expressly for the purpose of trying to
get a settlement, but had till now been unable to get even
an interview with the dealer, who was always too busy to
see him, but had at last agreed to have his agent meet him
at the khan. This was the meeting. The Phenician had
at first quietly represented the hardships of his case with
some hope of softening the agent, but, growing desperate,
he hotly rose from his seat and exclaimed in a voice that
was almost a wail:</p>

<p>“I shall be undone,—quite undone! Have you no
mercy?”</p>

<p>“Not much,” said the other, “for some people.”</p>

<p>“Thou flint! Before all the gods my claim is just.
What shall I do? My children will starve.”</p>

<p>“Let them. The fewer such brats the better. Business
is business. Take what I offer or nothing. You
have only yourself to blame; you shouldn’t cheat so.”</p>

<p>“<em>Cheat!</em>” exclaimed the Phenician in a transport of
wrath that for the moment drank up his tears like a hot
blast from the desert. “<em>Cheat!</em> you Cretan rascal! You
are a pretty fellow to advise against cheating; you who, I
verily believe, never did anything else; nor your fathers
either, for that matter. Who does not know what the
honesty of a Cretan is worth?”</p>

<p>By this time many had gathered around. Turning to
them, the Phenician besought their help to make his
debtor do him justice.</p>

<p>“Why not go to the judge?” said a by-stander.</p>

<p>“Ah, my friend, I have been imprudent. I cannot
<em>prove</em> that my goods were all right; for I was so careless
that I took it for granted that I was dealing with an honest<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span>
man, and so neglected to have them examined and
registered at Sidon. Besides, if I had done this, how
could I know but that the packages had been tampered
with on their way here? I could not swear that they
came into this man’s hands in as good condition as they
were when they left mine. But <em>he</em> could swear to anything.
Why shouldn’t he? He told me a little while
ago, while we were opening our conference with some
general talk, that he did not believe in any god or hereafter;
in short, that he had no religion of any sort. What
is to keep such a man from wronging his neighbor out of
his dues when it can be done safely?”</p>

<p>“This man speaks truth,” said a substantial looking
man hard by; “for, as I was passing here some time ago,
I overheard this atheist sneering at all religion. Said I
to myself, that man is a rogue. Is cheating too bad a
thing for such a fellow to do? Hassan thinks not.”</p>

<p>On this another cried out: “Some of us know Hassan.
His word is good. I think as he does: that a man who
has robbed himself of his conscience would not hesitate to
rob a Phenician of his goods.”</p>

<p>“Exactly so,” said another just behind, as he gave his
neighbor a push toward the Cretan. “A man who does
not believe in anything good believes in everything bad.”</p>

<p>“Oh, the fellow is an imitation philosopher, is he?
The genuine is bad enough, but an imitation is worse—mere
husks. And husks are thrown away. Let’s throw
him away;” and the speaker drew his girdle a hit
tighter.</p>

<p>“And <em>I</em> would not trust the rascal with a fig,” cried
another, as he shied a rather sorry specimen of the fruit
at the Cretan.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span></p>

<p>“Hustle him out—hustle him out,” cried several at
once, throwing up their hands.</p>

<p>The crowd seemed on the point of doing it. The
Cretan turned pale as he saw them moving upon him,
and began to retreat toward the gate. Seeing this, some of
the people ran and planted themselves in the way. Finding
himself intercepted, the man jumped on a bench and
cried in a frightened voice:</p>

<p>“Friends, do not harm me. I am only an agent in
this matter. I do what I am bid. My principal is
<span class="smcap">Malus</span>.”</p>

<p>Malus, Malus—the word passed from mouth to mouth
in a low tone. It seemed magical. At once the outcry
ceased. The billow of angry faces and hands that was
rushing toward the Cretan suddenly stood still, and then
slowly broke into many little whispering, murmuring
whirlpools. The way to the gate was no longer barred,
and the Cretan made his way to it precipitately, and disappeared.
There was no danger of pursuit.</p>

<p>The Phenician sat down again, and covered his face
with his hands. Our two friends talked together for a
few moments in a low tone. Then Aleph rose and went
to the man; and, after exchanging a few words with him,
conducted him to Cimon. A long conversation followed.
At last Cimon came forward to the edge of the piazza,
and beckoned for attention. He already had it—had indeed
been having it for some time; but seeing the gesture,
the people came nearer.</p>

<p>“I do not express any opinion,” said the Greek, “as
to the justice of this man’s cause. We have not at present
the means for judging that. But, unless all the usual
marks fail, this is a case of genuine distress; and one that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span>
is not likely to be helped by a resort to the courts. The
man confesses that he has been imprudent. Besides, he
is too poor to bear the expense of a suit. And if he could,
a suit would probably be in vain. When the weak contend
with the powerful, the weak must go to the wall.
So, rightly or wrongly, the poor man will lose his debt;
his family will suffer, and he will be in danger of losing
all heart by losing in his old age the labor of years. I
propose that we help him. The sum lost, though large
to him, would not be large to us. A small contribution
from each of us will set him on his feet again. Who of
you will join me in making it, perhaps in righting a great
wrong?”</p>

<p>And, stepping forward, he laid a piece of gold on the
bench where the Phenician had sat. Aleph rose and put
another by the side of it. Hassan promptly came up and
did the same. The example was followed by others, until
at last Aleph, coming forward and examining the amount
contributed, pronounced it quite sufficient to cover the
loss. He handed the sum to the Phenician.</p>

<p>The man seemed for a moment almost bewildered as
he received it. He then fell on his knees and thanked
his gods in a few trembling words; then springing to his
feet, he lifted up his voice and wept. At last he found
words and composure enough to say to the people:</p>

<p>“My friends, you have saved me. I was ready to die;
would gladly have died a few moments ago; but now I
can live, because my family can. I bless you in the name
of my little children. You may be sure that you have
not helped a rogue; the facts are as I have given them.
Before the gods I am an honest man, though I could not
prove it before your judges. Again I thank you; and,”<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[29]</a></span>
turning to Cimon and Aleph, “especially these two
friends, who, though strangers to me, have this day stood
between me and ruin. If Sansciano ever forgets them,
may....”</p>

<p>Here he fairly broke down, and suddenly turning to
one of the pillars that supported the piazza, buried his
face in his hand.</p>

<p>The sudden night of Egypt was now upon them, and
the torches began to flame. After exchanging a few more
words with the Phenician, the two friends withdrew to
their rooms; but not before they had caught glimpse of
a Roman uniform entering the little office near the gate
of the court. Did it give them any uneasiness? I hope
not. Borrowing trouble is poor business. Sufficient unto
the day is the evil thereof. And then, is there not a
shield broad as the heavens above the good? Trust it,
ye strangers, and go to sleep—if ye are indeed good.</p>

<p><em>Are</em> they good men? For one, I am inclined to
believe in them. Not so much because of their good
looks, as because they look good. Not so much from
what they have said and done during the few hours of
our acquaintance with them, as from a certain—well, let
the word be written, though deservedly somewhat unpopular
of late—<em>intuition</em>. There is something wonderfully
prepossessing in the look of both these strangers.
It is hard to say what that something is that so bespeaks
confidence, but that it exists and speaks mightily there
is no denying—at least by me. I seem to look right
through those frank and fearless yet kind eyes into
noble souls. It may be only a seeming. I shall not
attempt to justify myself to the philosophers. If they
choose to remind me that appearances are sometimes<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span>
deceptive; that virtue is often very cleverly imitated; in
short, that old proverbs declare that “All is not gold
that glitters,” and that “Fair outsides often cover foul
insides,” I have nothing to say against it. I shall not
argue the case with them. They would have the best of
it from the arguing stand-point. Intuitions cannot be
defended. So I will do nothing but express a modest
opinion that such well-appearing people will turn out as
good as they look. Even this, no doubt, will look sufficiently
foolish to some; and should they conclude to
suspend judgment as to the character of Cimon and
Aleph till they have seen more of them in the progress
of the narrative, I shall not complain. They are acting
sensibly—as the world goes. They certainly are on very
safe ground. “By their fruits ye shall know them” is
a maxim whose authority cannot be controverted. And
if, in the application of this maxim, they shall discover
that the two strangers are no better than they should be,
or as bad as the worst, I can only hang my head in confusion,
and confess that the logic of experience is better
than intuition—<em>my</em> intuition.</p>

<h3>III.<br />
<span class="smaller">THE BANKER.</span></h3>

<p>Whether Cimon and Aleph slept the sleep of the
just we must leave to be settled in the progress of
the narrative. I am, I again confess, prepossessed in their
favor. At any rate, they slept so soundly that most of
the guests of the khan had gone off on their various
affairs before the two friends made their appearance.</p>

<p>Perhaps, too, they were delayed by a cause that did
not delay many of their fellow-guests—morning worship.
It seems that they acknowledged Jehovah and a revelation
from him; and it is to be presumed that such people began
their day in the reasonable and old-fashioned way.
When have devout believers not acted on the principle
that prayer and provender hinder no man’s journey?
Besides, they breakfasted in their own room; whereas
most inmates of the khan patronized the cook shops that
abounded in the neighborhood.</p>

<p>After the meal they went out and seated themselves
on the bench they had occupied the evening before.</p>

<p>“The first thing to be done,” said Cimon, “is to find
a suitable banker and open an account with him for such
Alexandrian funds as we may need. As one of our objects
requires that we be unknown, and especially that our connection
with your father should not reach the ears of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[34]</a></span>
Malus, we cannot use our draft on him except in case of
absolute necessity. We must depend on the jewels. And
they are too valuable to be trusted to any but the best
hands. If the Jewish family that held the alabarchate
when I was here last is still in business, this would be the
one to apply to. They were as noted for their integrity
as for their immense wealth and influence at Rome. I
will go and ask our deputy-host whether they have now
any representative in Alexandria.”</p>

<p>After a short absence the Greek returned with two
canes in his hand, and with the information that the old
banking-house was flourishing more than ever in the person
of Alexander, the son of the old Alabarch; that the
son had succeeded to all his father’s honors and more
than his father’s wealth; and that, as the imperial
banker, his influence at Rome was supposed to be even
greater than among his own people for whom he had
lately enriched the nine gates of the temple at Jerusalem
with gold plates of enormous value. It was generally
understood in the city that he had lately prevented certain
oppressive measures against the Jews of Antioch by
threatening to withhold a loan. Some went so far as to
tell how many millions of sesterces each minute brought
him, and even supposed that he had discovered the art of
turning base metals into gold.</p>

<p>“I am sorry that we did not ask Seti about the present
Alabarch,” said Cimon; “but I have no doubt from
what I know of the family that he is the person to whom
we should apply.”</p>

<p>“I have also learned two other facts,” he continued.
“One is that the greatest galley in all the three harbors
is Malus himself, and that the Cretan of last night is one<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[35]</a></span>
of several small tenders that wait on the great ship and
do its meaner work—which means that the oversight of
the harbors and of the import trade has mainly fallen
into the hands of Malus and his agents, and that the fear
of him is on all small dealers, whom he could easily crush,
especially as he is on the best of terms with the Roman
authorities of the city. The other fact is that a Roman
soldier was at the khan-office last night to inquire whether
two men (describing us) were staying here. The deputy
said that he managed not to enlighten the man much—as
it was always safe to assume that what a Roman wanted
to know ought not to be known.”</p>

<p>“Would it not be well for us,” said the young man,
“to make some changes in our dress so as to embarrass
such inquiries?... I am glad to see that you have brought
in your hand something to help us discourage unpleasant
recognitions,” he added with a smile and a glance at the
canes. “They have a tough and serviceable look.”</p>

<p>“They certainly may be useful on occasion. But
every gentleman in Alexandria is in the habit of carrying
a cane; for us to do the same will help ward off notice as
well as assault. Dogs and donkeys abound; and some of
them walk on two legs. A stout stick, with your skill at
fence and thrust, will be almost as good as a sword.... As
to making some changes in dress, I think your suggestion
a good one. I also think that it would be well for you,
at least, to dress somewhat more richly to-day, inasmuch
as you must be the one to do our business with the banker.
Till one is known appearance goes far. Meanwhile I will
brush up my knowledge of the city and its people. We
will meet here late in the day.”</p>

<p>Cimon then produced his tablets and drew on them a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a></span>
rough plan of the city—one central street, two hundred
feet broad, running between the lake and the sea from the
gate of the Moon to the gate of the Sun, and called Emporium
Street: this crossed in the middle at right angles
by another street of similar breadth, but of much less
length, called the street of Canopus, ending on the west
at the gate of the Necropolis, and on the east at the gate
of Canopus: these two main streets cut at right angles by
all the rest: here, in the south-east, the Jews’ quarter,
occupying two of the five divisions of the city: there,
north of this quarter and extending to the two harbors
Eunostus and Kibotus, and including all the frontage on
these harbors called Bruchium, the Greek and Roman
quarters. These latter also include a narrow section of
the city lying along the whole length of Emporium Street
on the west. Just west of this section is Rachotis or the
Egyptian quarter, in the southern part of which, on the
highest ground in the city, stands the Serapeum, the
famous temple of Jupiter Serapis.</p>

<p>“Entering at the gate of the Moon,” continued Cimon,
“you are to pass up Emporium Street till you come to
the street of Canopus: here turn to your right, and, after
a short walk, you will find by inquiry the place of the
great banker.”</p>

<p>Surely, the way was so plain that no guide would be
needed. So, after making some changes in his dress,
Aleph took his cane and set forth.</p>

<p>By this time the whole Alexandrian world, the most
industrious and bustling world known in ancient times,
was in full movement. Such tides of men surging from
sea to lake and from lake to sea—such tides of donkeys
and horses and camels going and coming—such a menagerie<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[37]</a></span>
and roar of sounds from the tramp of thousands, the
shrill calls of traders hawking their wares, the cries of the
animals and their drivers, the infinite clatter from the
tools of artisans of every name pouring out from the open
shops far and near! Slowly on went the young man,
with eyes full of grave interest, along the splendid thoroughfare
for two miles, till he came to the ornate square,
half a league in circumference, from the centre of which
one could, without changing his place, see the lake on
the south and the harbors with their dividing mole
(Heptastadium) and its Pharos on the north, as well as
the sands of the desert at both ends of the street of
Canopus. Turning down this street to the east under
one of the magnificent colonnades that skirted it on
either hand, he noticed as he advanced not only that the
leading places of business were held by Jews (a fact that
he had noticed on the other street), but that the farther
he went the more people he saw with Jewish features.</p>

<p>Before he had gone very far, two young men with
caps and black gowns, something like the present English
university dress, hurried by him; one saying to the other
as they passed:</p>

<p>“The earlier at the Alabarch’s the better. First
come, first served, you know.”</p>

<p>Aleph quickened his pace so as to keep near them.
They soon came to what seemed a fortress rather than a
private dwelling or place of business—solid stone, no windows
on the first story, length on the street several times
that of an ordinary dwelling. Solidity and strength
rather than show was the impression given—no elaborate
carvings, no pillars of porphyry and cornelian, but plain,
massive, mob-defying marble; in short, an architectural<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[38]</a></span>
<em>safe</em>. This structure was on a corner. Turning the corner,
the young men came by a few steps to a small door.
Aleph followed closely; and when the door opened to the
others, he entered with them and was ushered into a reception-room
close by, where many others were already
waiting their turn to be called into the presence of the
financial magnate.</p>

<p>Soon a servant presented on a silver salver tablets to
the new-comers, on which each should write his name.
When the tablets came to Aleph he noticed that the
names of the two young men who had just written were
<i>P. Cornelius, Serapeum</i>, and <i>Q. Metellus, Museum</i>.
What did <em>he</em> write? After a moment’s hesitation he wrote
<i>Aleph, the Chaldean, khan near the gate of the Moon</i>.</p>

<p>There were several academic uniforms in the room
(each with a conspicuous gold badge in front) that seemed
well acquainted with one another, and not disposed to
lose the time of waiting, possibly long, in silence. Some
talked together with great enthusiasm of a boat-race that
had come off the day before on the lake: others discussed
the merits of various recent performances in the palæstra,
especially those of a certain noted athlete and trainer who
had just arrived from Rome: two agreed that there was
nothing worth living for but the noble art of fencing, and
that the greatest living master of the art was one Draco of
Rhodes, of whom they were taking lessons. A knot of
dudes were comparing breast-pins and finger-rings and
experiences at the last fashionable party; or boasting of
the successful tricks they had played on the lecturers at
the Museum, and of how they managed to evade many of
the lectures and delude their parents and other friends at
home with the idea that they were hard at work digging<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[39]</a></span>
into all the sciences and philosophies and living like hermits
on crusts and water. Some were ready to burst with
merriment over some practical jokes they had played on
some citizen or new-comer at the Museum; or at the way
in which they had baffled the police in a midnight brawl.</p>

<p>The two students who came in with Aleph seemed
better to deserve the name. They had just come from a
lecture by Philo, a brother of the Alabarch; and found
much to commend in his ingenious attempts to Hellenize
the Hebrew writers or to Hebraize the Greek—they were
uncertain which way to put it. They agreed that he was
a very broad man and ready to do justice to great men of
other nationality than his own. They were also hearing
lectures on astronomy and Hipparchus in the observatory
rooms at the Serapeum, as well as on the physics and
metaphysics of Aristotle at the Museum.</p>

<p>Aleph was not sorry to have this little insight into
student life in Alexandria; and, considering the number
of persons in the room on his arrival, he was expecting to
have a still longer time to observe and listen, when, to his
surprise and apparently to that of others around, a special
servant came to conduct him to the banker.</p>

<p>After passing through a large room occupied by many
persons busy at desks, and crossing a broad passage from
which rose a flight of marble steps, they came to a small
room plainly furnished, in which were seated two men.
What was his surprise to recognize in one of them the
Egyptian Seti! The pleasure he felt sprang at once to
his face, as he advanced with a warm but modest greeting
which the aged man cordially reciprocated, and then presented
him to the Alabarch as “the young man of whom
we have been speaking.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[40]</a></span></p>

<p>Alexander was a Jew to the slightest inspection. But
his features though national were royally so, and might
have belonged to Solomon. Their whole expression bespoke
one accustomed to great thoughts and plans; while
yet a certain watchfulness, like distant pickets about a
royal encampment, looked out from far back in his frank
and friendly eyes as of one who knows that all sorts of
characters will come to a banker, and who knows how to
protect himself on occasion. His manners were polished
and courtly—as might have been expected in one who
dealt only with the highest and most cultured classes, and
was even a companion of princes. In watching him one
felt sure that the man was larger than his wealth, however
large that might be. He was still in the prime of life,
and without a thread of silver in his dark hair and
beard.</p>

<p>Alexander received the young man graciously, though
with wide-open, all-observing eyes.</p>

<p>“I happened,” said the Egyptian to Aleph, “to be
with my son when your name was brought in; and,
though you gave me no name yesterday, I fancied that
the Chaldean was the friend I have occasion to remember,
and that his first business would naturally be with a
banker. I had just finished explaining how we met when
you came in.”</p>

<p>“That I am as glad as surprised,” returned the young
man, “to see you here and in such a relation, you doubtless
have already discovered. Perhaps I am the more glad
because my business with this gentleman is such as may
call for a word of friendly prepossession in my favor from
one who is known here. For the present I am compelled
to remain unknown. I can only appear as Aleph, the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[41]</a></span>
Chaldean, in company with his preceptor and friend,
Cimon the Athenian. So I have no papers to present on
which to ask an open account for him and myself, within
certain limits, with a banker. I have only certain jewels
to place in his hands, of the value of which he must
judge”—and he drew from the bosom of his tunic a
small box which he opened and handed to Alexander.</p>

<p>The banker was surprised. In all his wide experience
he had never fallen in with such brilliants—so large, so
beautifully and variously hued, with such soft and mystic
fires playing about them and raying out from their inmost
depths. A pearl, a ruby, a sapphire, and a diamond—that
was all; but, as Alexander turned the box this way
and that, there flashed out upon him such lovely lights
as he had never seen in the imperial treasury at Rome,
enriched as it was with the regalia of many nations.</p>

<p>After carefully taking out each gem and examining it
on all sides, and then as carefully replacing it in its luxurious
bed, Alexander at length fetched a long breath and
slowly said:</p>

<p>“If any common stranger had brought me these remarkable
jewels I should have demanded to know his
name and station—in short, that he is the rightful owner
of such a treasure. This would only be common prudence.
But I happen to have an uncommon father-in-law, who
has a notion that he has a gift of reading character in
faces and bearing, and who thinks so favorably of yours
that he might quarrel with me if I should deal with you
on strictly business principles. I should be sorry to have
him do that. Besides, to tell the truth, I have something
of his weakness for a good face and figure, and whatever
else that indescribable something about you is that demands<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[42]</a></span>
confidence. So I think I will venture”—and he
threw an arch look and smile at Seti.</p>

<p>And he drew two sheets of papyrus toward himself.
After writing for some time, he read over to himself carefully
what he had written, and then handed the sheet to
Aleph, saying, “Is this satisfactory?”</p>

<p>The young man read a full description of the box and
its contents; an acknowledgment of the receipt of it as
basis for credit to the extent of 200,000 aurei or staters,
to be drawn upon at pleasure in large or small sums; also
a promise to restore the jewels on repayment of sums advanced
with a moderate interest.</p>

<p>Aleph pronounced the paper entirely satisfactory, and
far more favorable than he had any reason to expect—adding,
however, that he had no idea of making any large
drafts on the sum pledged; as one of the objects he had
in view in Alexandria would compel him to live in a very
quiet and inexpensive way, even if it were not a matter of
choice.</p>

<p>Alexander then proceeded to copy the document, and
to affix his signature and seal to it and to the copy. He
retained one and gave the other to Aleph, with a parcel
of small slips of papyrus each already signed by himself,
but otherwise blank, saying:</p>

<p>“Whenever you wish current money, fill in one of
these with the sum desired, in your own handwriting and
with your name as given to-day, and present it in the
room through which you passed in coming here....
Now I will put this treasure where it will be somewhat
safer than it was when walking the streets of Alexandria
under the protection of a cane”—and he rose and took
the box and his copy of the paper he had just executed to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[43]</a></span>
carry them into an adjoining room whose door, massive
with iron, proclaimed the very citadel of the financial
stronghold.</p>

<p>“Will you add this small parcel of valuable documents
to the box?” said Aleph, as he again produced from
the bosom of his tunic an elaborately tied and sealed
parcel.</p>

<p>Alexander had hardly resumed his seat, after a few
moments’ absence, when a light step was heard descending
the stairs in the neighboring passage, the door softly
opened a little, then wider, and after a moment a young
lady advanced into the room. Seti and Aleph were so
seated that they could not well be seen from the door;
and the maiden seeing none but Alexander went hastily
up to him, put her hand on his shoulder, kissed his forehead,
and said:</p>

<p>“Father, word has just been brought me that my poor
nurse Miriam, who has come back to the city sick, is
now dying, and wants to see me. May I take a servant
with me and go? In the absence of my mother and
brothers, I thought I had better come directly to you, as
I may need to be gone for some time, and you would be
alarmed at my prolonged absence.”</p>

<p>“Certainly I would have been. Take two servants:
then you can send one of them back for anything that
may be needed. Let the woman have every possible help
and comfort. But, Rachel, you do not notice your grandfather!”—nodding
his head toward Seti, who had risen
and was coming toward her.</p>

<p>Rachel turned suddenly, with a faint exclamation of
surprise, and sprang into the open arms of the Egyptian,
exclaiming:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[44]</a></span></p>

<p>“When did you come? I thought you were still in
Upper Egypt. How glad I am to see you, my dear grandfather—as
glad as one can be whose foster-mother lies
dying!”</p>

<p>“I will not keep you from her—only to answer your
question by saying that I reached the city safely last evening,
thanks to a young friend of mine. No particulars at
present. Perhaps I will step in at Miriam’s on my way
home (I accidentally heard of her whereabouts this morning),
and see if the leech has done his best, and, if not,
whether old Egypt can do better.”</p>

<p>“Do, grandfather,” she pleaded, “and come soon:
for I verily believe that the priest Seti knows more of the
healing art than all the rest of Alexandria—the daughters
of my people not excepted.”</p>

<p>As she glided toward the door her eye rested for a
moment with a startled look on Aleph. He had till now
been unobserved. The tall form of Seti had been interposed.
She hesitated a moment, as if to make sure that
the young man was not some one whom she ought to
recognize, and then hastened away.</p>

<p>Ah, those great, lovely eyes! It was but a second that
their inquiring look rested on him; but they at once made
him forget every other feature. He had not failed to
notice her faultless figure, the queenly carriage of her
head, the easy grace and even majesty of her every movement;
and when she turned to greet Seti he had had full
view of an exquisite face, hesitating between girlhood and
womanhood—a face wonderfully luminous with a certain
spiritual and lofty loveliness—but the moment her eyes
shot their fires into his, all previous impressions vanished,
and he saw nothing but <em>eyes, eyes</em>. In talking over the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[45]</a></span>
events of the day with Cimon at the khan in the evening,
he could not, for the life of him, remember distinctly
whether she was tall or short, dark or brown-haired, light-complexioned
or otherwise—he could only remember the
glorious <em>eyes</em>. But the young man was in Alexandria for
a purpose, and a great one: and what had he to do with a
maiden’s haunting eyes? Just nothing at all. So he
turned his own eyes to the business in hand: and the
effulgent twin stars that had just risen above his horizon,
contrary to the order of Nature, silently sank back again
and disappeared—almost.</p>

<p>He rose to take leave. But Alexander said, <i>Wait a
little</i>, and touched a string. A servant appeared, to
whom he gave some directions in a low voice. When he
had dismissed the man, he said that he had just sent to
notify those in waiting that no more business would be
done to-day. He added that he usually closed business
earlier on the sixth day of the week out of regard to the
sacred seventh, and that so he had some leisure for conversation;
if the young man would resume his seat.</p>

<p>“Speaking of our Sabbath,” continued he; “reminds
me that I ought to invite you to our place of worship for
to-morrow: for I learn that you are not a worshipper of
Belus?”</p>

<p>“Hardly,” said Aleph with a smile.</p>

<p>“Nor a fire-worshipper?”</p>

<p>“By no means.”</p>

<p>“Nor a worshipper of the sun, moon and stars?”</p>

<p>“I was not so taught,” emphatically.</p>

<p>“But you were taught to worship the One God who
made the heavens and the earth, and who spake by Moses
and our other prophets?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[46]</a></span></p>

<p>“Even so: our family religion for generations has
been that of the Hebrews—as being the most credible and
satisfactory within our knowledge.”</p>

<p>“Our common friend here could not tell me quite as
much as this,” said Alexander with a gratified look, “but
I am glad to hear it, and hope to learn at some future
time how your family came into possession of our faith.
You observe our sacred day?”</p>

<p>“I do, as does also my companion. Though a Greek
by birth, he is a Hebrew in religion. We will be pleased
to accept your invitation for to-morrow. Where shall we
find your place of worship?”</p>

<p>“We Jews are 300,000 strong. So there are several
synagogues in the city; but two of these are much larger
than the rest, and stand for two different schools of doctrine
among us. The one with which I am connected is
the <i>Diapleuston</i> and is on the street of Canopus, not far
from here. The other is on Emporium Street, and is not
so large as ours, but still has many substantial adherents,
of whom Malus, our chief shipping merchant, is the most
prominent. Indeed, I think that he is now the chief ruler
of his synagogue.”</p>

<p>“May I ask,” inquired Aleph, “what the doctrinal
difference between the two synagogues is?”</p>

<p>“The chief difference,” answered Alexander, “relates
to the degree of authority to be allowed to our Sacred
Books. We of the <i>Diapleuston</i> say that their authority is
final on all matters of which they speak—that their writers
were so guided and guarded by Jehovah in composing
them that they were at first perfectly free from mistake
of all sorts: while the other school maintain that, while
properly enough said to be of divine origin, our Scriptures<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[47]</a></span>
have always been more or less mistaken in their teachings
and need to be sifted by learned men.”</p>

<p>“Do these men offer any criterion by which one may
separate the reliable from the unreliable?”</p>

<p>“They do not <em>agree</em> on any. One says that all important
Scripture statements are reliable; another tells
us that all are reliable, save in the domains of history and
science; another excludes as unreliable all but positively
<em>religious</em> statements.”</p>

<p>“Of course they differ widely as to what <em>are</em> important
or strictly religious matters.”</p>

<p>“Certainly. Whatever statements are unsatisfactory
to a man for any reason he is apt to think of small consequence.”</p>

<p>“And I should suppose the other test might be
equally elusive. Is there not room for considerable difference
of opinion as to what deserve to be called moral
and religious statements?”</p>

<p>“So it seems: and, as a matter of fact, Malus and his
synagogue agree only in discrediting those parts of the
Scriptures that are in the narrative form and a large part
of the remainder. Especially are they prepared to admit
the possibility of mistake to almost any extent in Moses
and the earlier Scripture writers. Not a few deny that
we have any Moses. What passes under the ancient name
is really the invention of recent times.”</p>

<p>“This is the result I should expect. One seems to be
left at liberty to take as much or little of the Scriptures
as suits him: for if parts of them are unreliable, and we
have no sure way of determining where these parts are,
we will be likely to locate them where our prejudices and
inclinations say. The larger part of the Book may easily<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[48]</a></span>
be considered secular or unimportant by one who wishes
as much.”</p>

<p>“Very true,” said Alexander; “and see what the
other synagogue have actually come to! Some reject the
doctrine of angels, some that of a human soul distinct
from the body, some that of personal responsibility, and
nearly all that of miracles and all other forms of supernaturalism
in history, as well as that of a future state of
settled character and destiny for men. And so on.
Really, between them all, there is very little of the sacred
Book left. The sum of their doubts and denials would
cover almost the whole of it. What is left is the brief
revelation that Malus, the Sadducee, uses. His maxim
is to discard what anybody doubts.”</p>

<p>“This seems to me a sad state of things,” said Aleph,
fetching a long breath that was almost a sigh. “It would
be almost unimaginable in the house of my fathers.
Practically these people are without a revelation. The
only revelation to each is that bundle of guesses and notions
which he calls his knowledge or judgments: and
there are about as many different revelations of this sort
as there are men; and, to my thinking, they are all about
equally worthless. It is sad that circumcised people
should hold such uncircumcised notions.”</p>

<p>“A sad state of things, indeed,” consented Alexander,
“but we may console ourselves with the fact that this sad
sort of people are a minority and a small one, and have
been quite unknown among our people till quite recent
times. I trust they will soon become unknown again.
When the Messiah, whom we are daily looking for, comes
and, accrediting himself by signs and wonders, declares<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[49]</a></span>
that not one jot or tittle of the law shall fail, even Malus
will have a revelation that is worth the having.”</p>

<p>“May He come quickly!” said the young man devoutly.</p>

<p>Alexander looked intently for a moment on the kindling
and abstracted face before him, and then as devoutly
said <i>Amen</i>.</p>

<p>During this conversation Seti maintained an unbroken
silence—his arms folded, his face impassive, but his eyes
as watchful as eagles’. He seemed to be hearing as well
as seeing with those ancient eyes of his that never once
left the face of Aleph.</p>

<p>They both rose at the same time—Seti saying that he
would walk along with the young man and point out the
Diapleuston in passing.</p>

<p>The Alabarch courteously escorted them through the
now vacant rooms to the door; saying to Aleph, as he
parted, “Remember—at the third hour to-morrow. Come
half an hour earlier.”</p>

<p>Turning into the street of Canopus, and going westward
under the colonnade, they soon came to a corner on
which stood an imposing structure of white marble. As
Aleph glanced down the side street he saw that the length
of the structure was immense: as he passed to the front
he saw that its breadth was nearly as great. A central
part raised on a lofty pediment, surmounted by a gilded
dome, and supported in front and on either hand by immense
monolith columns, was surrounded on all visible
sides at a little distance by low marble cloisters—save
where a broad flight of steps led up from the street to the
great doors. From the wide platform at the top the great<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[50]</a></span>
columns rose in elaborately wrought clusters, each supporting
an ornate capital, architrave, frieze, and cornice;
while, behind, the whole front was alive with spirited
sculpture in relief of the Feast of Tabernacles.</p>

<p>I must not forget to add that at one angle the low
cloisters swelled into a graceful and lofty tower that ended
in a parapet.</p>

<p>“From behind that parapet,” said Seti, pointing,
“are sounded the seventy silver trumpets that summon
the Jews to their worship; for here is the Diapleuston
to which you have been invited.”</p>

<p>They passed on to another crossing.</p>

<p>“Let us turn down this street,” said the Egyptian.
“It is less crowded than the thoroughfare, and equally
direct for both of us, as I learn that you are staying for
the present near where we landed yesterday. Besides, I
wish to stop for a few moments with the sick woman. I
am afraid of these Alexandrian leeches. Once in every
five or ten years they get a new fashion of treating diseases
and call it science.”</p>

<p>They turned south and soon came to a humble house,
where Seti knocked. The door was opened by a shiftless
looking Greek who, on request, pointed to a door within
which the sick woman could be found. On entering,
they found her on a rude bed, supported almost in a sitting
posture by the daughter of Alexander, who sat behind
her. She was a woman of middle age, very emaciated,
eyes closed, lips parted, chest laboriously heaving, apparently
unconscious.</p>

<p>“Oh, grandfather, I feared you would not come,”
exclaimed the maiden in a subdued voice, “feared you
would be too late,—I am afraid you <em>are</em> too late. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[51]</a></span>
leech says that nothing more can be done”—and the
tears dropped fast from the lovely eyes.</p>

<p>The rich dress worn at home had been exchanged for
one exceedingly plain and suited to her present sad and
humble surroundings. But the change did not detract
from her superb loveliness. On the contrary, the exquisite
graces of feature and figure became all the more
apparent in the absence of the distractions of extrinsic
ornament; and a new light born of a heavenly pity and
self-forgetfulness was shining in her face.</p>

<p>Without replying to her words, Seti advanced to a
casement and door, and threw them widely open on a
small open court.</p>

<p>“But the leech, grandfather, said that the fresh air
must be excluded.”</p>

<p>“Did he bring this?” said the Egyptian, taking up
from the bed a partly unrolled manuscript. He read
aloud: “<i>The Psalms of David translated by the Seventy</i>.”</p>

<p>“That is mine,” said Rachel. “I brought it with
me, and have read from it to Miriam while she could
listen. It was her only comfort, besides prayer.”</p>

<p>“What have you learned about her case?”</p>

<p>“You know that she left us two years ago to marry a
man whom we could not approve: and until yesterday we
did not know what had become of her. Then I had a
message from her husband, who is a Greek, that she was
sick at this place. I went to her at once and found her
very weak and low with this fever; and gathered from
her with great difficulty that she had led a life of hardship
and exposure since leaving us, had sometimes been
in the extreme of want, but was ashamed to make her<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[52]</a></span>
situation known to us after having rejected our counsel.
So she had gradually been worn down by want and disappointment
until this fever seized on her and found an
easy victim”—and the fair head drooped with a sigh to
the hot forehead that rested against her shoulder.</p>

<p>“Has she asked for nothing?” inquired Seti.</p>

<p>“Not of late. When I first came she wanted water,
and asked for it almost constantly. But the leech said
she must not have it. It would chill her and finally make
the fever worse. He would only allow her lips to be
moistened occasionally with a sponge.”</p>

<p>“Her lips are trying to move now. Can you hear
anything?”</p>

<p>“Nothing.”</p>

<p>Seti stooped and put his ear close to the lips of the
dying woman. He shook his head.</p>

<p>“Old age,” said he, “has its disadvantages, and dull
ears are one of them. Perhaps my young friend here can
help us”—and he beckoned to Aleph, who had remained
at some distance.</p>

<p>The young man at once came forward, and, kneeling
by the bed, laid his ear close to the twitching lips. For
a few moments he seemed not to breathe at all. As Seti
looked down on that noble head with its wealth of youth
and strength in broad contrast with the sharp, worn features
of the sick woman, he said to himself: “It is the
head of Horus, the sun-god.”</p>

<p>At length Aleph rose. “She says <i>water, water</i>—that
and nothing else.”</p>


<p>“Give her water, then,” commanded Seti.</p>

<p>“But the leech, grandfather!” interposed the maiden
anxiously.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[53]</a></span></p>

<p>“No matter what the leech says. I too am a leech.
Let her drink freely.”</p>

<p>Aleph took up the water-jar that was standing by the
bed, poured into a large cup that was near till it was
almost full, and held it to the lips of the woman—saying
to Rachel as he did so: “It is the way of my country.”
The dry lips closed spasmodically over the rim of the cup,
and did not release it till not a drop was left. She opened
her eyes. A faint sigh of relief reached the younger ears.</p>

<p>“Give her another cup,” said Seti.</p>

<p>She drained that also: then whispered <i>Heaven</i>—so
that they all heard, and almost a smile hovered upon her
wan features. Great drops stood on her forehead, and
she quietly sank into sleep.</p>

<p>“Now lay her down softly,” said the Egyptian to the
maiden, “and let her sleep. She will do well. What
has she eaten?”</p>

<p>“Nothing since I have been here. The leech said
that food would not nourish her: it would only nourish
the fever.”</p>

<p>“Has she never asked for anything in particular?”</p>

<p>“The woman who was here when I came tells me that
before nurse became so weak she asked for fried lampreys
and onions. But the leech said that she could not ask
for a worse dish. It would kill her outright. And, what
was worse, it would kill him too; for it would ruin
his practice to allow such a thing. It was against all
rules.”</p>

<p>“Never you mind his rules. Tell the woman—but
here she is; I will tell her myself,” and he turned toward
a peasant woman, who had just softly entered and was
standing embarrassed at the presence of strangers. “When<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[54]</a></span>
this sick person wakes let her drink all the water she
wants. Then ask her if she can think of anything she
would like to eat, calling over to her all the eatables you
can think of, and whatever she chooses get for her, even
though it is fried lampreys or fried dragons. Do you
understand?”</p>

<p>“Yes, my lord; but the leech ...”</p>

<p>“Will see that these instructions of Seti are obeyed.
If not, send word at once to this lady.... Now, Rachel,
you ought to go home at once. Though you are not unaccustomed
to such work as this, I can see that you are
tired and worn. If you were of the fainting sort I should
hold out my arms to catch you from falling—your cheeks
are so white and your eyes so——”</p>

<p>She would have fallen had she not hastily staggered
toward him and caught his arm.</p>

<p>“Yes, grandfather, I think I had better go home as
soon as possible,” she said in a low and trembling voice.
“The closeness of the room till you came, together with
the anxiety and excitement, has been too much for me.
But the open air will set me right.”</p>

<p>“Ought not the lady to have a sedan?” inquired
Aleph. “I saw a stand at the last corner as we came.”</p>

<p>“Certainly,” said Seti: “and where are the two
servants, Rachel, who came with you?”</p>

<p>“Are they not at the door? I left them there, to be
within call.”</p>

<p>“I did not notice them when we came. Did you?”—turning
to Aleph.</p>

<p>Aleph shook his head. “Allow me to go for a sedan,”
said he, “and we will see the lady safely home.”</p>

<p>“Thank you—that will do.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[55]</a></span></p>

<p>Aleph hastened away. During his absence, which was
short, Rachel reclined; and on his return with a chair
and two stout porters he found her much revived and
quite disposed to dismiss the vehicle as being unnecessary.
But this Seti would not permit. And she speedily found
that he was right; for, on trying to walk to the door, she
found it necessary to accept support from both men. But
the open air of the street seemed to recall her strength at
once, and she entered the sedan without help.</p>

<p>Seti walked before the vehicle to guide. Aleph walked
behind—every now and then quieting the motion of the
bearers by a word, and once or twice venturing to draw
aside the curtain and inquire in a grave, sympathetic way
how the lady was enduring the jolting. The answer was
satisfactory and cordial: and when the house of Alexander
was reached she professed to feel as well and strong as
ever, and proved it by darting up the steps without aid.
Turning, as the door opened, she threw down thanks and
adieu with the gesture of a goddess and disappeared.</p>

<p>“There goes the Gem of Alexandria,” murmured Seti
to himself.</p>

<p>Aleph said nothing, but he thought that, whatever the
gem, it was a wonderfully fine casket that contained it.
He was sure that he had never seen a finer. And those
<em>eyes</em>! As he turned away the twin stars again ventured
to show themselves above his horizon in all their dewy
splendors. But what had he to do with a maiden’s starry
eyes? Just nothing at all. So back they timidly sank
to the horizon’s edge; but refused to go farther. They
must wait till they had burned a path through.</p>

<p>That evening at the khan Cimon and Aleph compared
experiences. Cimon had revived his acquaintance with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[56]</a></span>
the city, but had not found any of his old acquaintances.
Thirty years and more had dismissed all of them to new
homes or to the Necropolis. No directory made it possible
for him to be sure but that, somewhere in the great
city, some one whom he had known as a young man was
still living with whitening locks; but no doubt nearly all
of his generation were dead. That was the way of things
in Alexandria: as it is everywhere else. Cimon was sad
that night. O Time, thou mighty thief, when will Government
apprehend thee and bring thee to justice! Or,
better still, when will it take thy scythe from thee, and
put thee into some Reformatory to learn giving instead of
stealing, addition instead of subtraction, flowing instead
of ebbing, the art of ever setting poor men forward from
strength to strength instead of backward from weakness
to weakness! Well, that is what will be done some day—for
some. For whom?</p>

<h3>IV.<br />
<span class="smaller">THE SYNAGOGUE.</span></h3>

<p>If the reader is curious to know how the two friends
passed the long Sabbath morning, before it was time
to go to the synagogue, I can inform him. They prayed
apart, they prayed together; they produced a copy of the
Septuagint and read what the prophets had written about
the Messiah. They found many mysteries, and much
material for conversation, until the dial in the centre of
the court told them that it was time to be moving.</p>

<p>On their way up Emporium Street they kept to the
right side for two reasons—because the right was first
reached, and because on that side the current of people
was in their own direction. And a strong current it was.
Men, women, and children, with Jewish faces and apparently
dressed in their best, in great numbers were leisurely
moving northward. Aleph was tall enough to look over
the heads of most of the people before him and noticed in
the distance the living stream turning into a building. It
occurred to him that this building was probably the synagogue
of Malus, of which the Alabarch had spoken. He
was confirmed in this idea by the light behavior of most
about him. The principle of reverence was neither in
their feet nor in their faces. And as to their tongues—these
seemed to have the freedom of all the days of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[60]</a></span>
week. They were talking shop, talking ships, talking
fashions, talking gossip—talking everything but politics
and religion. These last topics they prudently left to the
Romans and “whom it might concern.”</p>

<p>When they came to the synagogue they saw that it
was large; though by no means as large and imposing as
the Diapleuston. They lingered a little among the many
standing on the street in order to get a better view. Just
then came up a group of persons more richly dressed than
the rest, and for whom the rest made way with special
deference as they mounted the steps. One of these, whose
dress was particularly showy, turned when he had reached
the last platform, and looked down among the people as
if seeking some one. His eye rested on Aleph. Both
Cimon and Aleph noticed an involuntary start. It could
hardly have been greater if the man had received an unexpected
blow.</p>

<p>He was a man of middle stature, somewhat past middle
life, and more than middlingly obese. His face was
a curiosity. It was as round as a full moon, and as
pocked: but the great peculiarity of it was its characterless
or wooden expression. It neither laughed nor cried,
it neither promised nor threatened, it was neither happy
nor miserable, it was neither saint nor sinner. Yet one
hesitates a little over this last statement. There was a
certain thin, very thin, something about the face that
asked to be considered religious. But to the eyes of our
friends it seemed sanctimoniousness instead of sanctity, a
gauze white veil which, however well worn, is no part of
the person and can be put off at pleasure. Perhaps they
were mistaken. Sudden judgments sometimes shoot wide
of the mark. And it was but a moment they had in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[61]</a></span>
which to study his face before he disappeared within the
synagogue.</p>

<p>Cimon turned to a by-stander, and asked: “The
ruler of the synagogue?” The man bowed assent.</p>

<p>“I wonder,” said Cimon, musingly, as they passed
on, “whether Malus recognized your father in you. You
resemble him strongly—as he was, thirty years ago.”</p>

<p>As they came up to the Diapleuston there burst from
the summit of the side tower a chorus of trumpets—rich,
soft, yet far-sounding. Looking up they saw seventy
men standing behind a circular balustrade and chanting
through silver trumpets toward all points of the compass.</p>

<p>“How amiable are thy tabernacles, O Lord of Hosts,”
went sounding broadly forth over the city.</p>

<p>They were met just within the doors by Alexander
himself—to whom Aleph presented his “preceptor and
friend” Cimon. The Alabarch received them with great
courtesy, and thanked the young man for the service rendered
to his daughter the day before; and when Aleph
expressed the hope that she had quite recovered from her
indisposition, he said:</p>

<p>“Quite so, she tells me; and so I have brought her
with me to give thanks for the good news this morning
received that her nurse continues to mend.”</p>

<p>And he led the way toward a distant canopy not far
from the centre, near which his daughter was sitting.
She was simply dressed and closely veiled; but Aleph
had no difficulty in recognizing the exquisite shape and
bearing of the Gem of Alexandria.</p>

<p>Alexander then said that he had asked them to come
somewhat in advance of the congregation, partly in order
that they might have time to look about them, and to get<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[62]</a></span>
familiar with the building before the services should
begin.</p>

<p>“Walk about freely,” he continued, “until the trumpets
cease summoning; then return and occupy the seats
yonder (he pointed). They are reserved for visitors in
accord with us. Meanwhile I have to meet the elders.”</p>

<p>He bowed himself away; and they began to look
about them. But few people had yet come in. It was
the largest and finest synagogue in the world. Just before
them, abutting on the east side of the building, was a low
platform surrounded by a delicate silver railing and surmounted
in part by a canopy of cloth of gold. Under
this was an ornate seat curiously wrought in various
precious woods. Near the front of the platform stood
an equally elaborate reading desk, with several rolls upon
it. By the side of the platform was a door by which
Alexander had disappeared; and in front of the platform,
arranged in several semicircles, were the famous seventy
gilded chairs for the seventy elders of the synagogue.
Back of these were the seats for the families of the elders
with a narrow aisle separating the males from the females.
On the first seat to the left of this passage sat Rachel.
Behind these seats, and skirted by immense columns on
either hand, ran a broad aisle from end to end of the
synagogue. The building was so long that the signal for
the responses had to be given by a flag to the more remote
worshippers; for all were expected to join vocally in the
prayers as read at the centre, though addresses to the
people were made simultaneously at several other platforms
placed at convenient intervals. The walls were
covered with Scripture verses in both Hebrew and Greek,
beautifully done in mosaic—one wall with prayers, another<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[63]</a></span>
with praises, a third with the Ten Commandments,
a fourth with the leading Messianic prophecies. One
mystery of the building was the pleasant illumination
without any sign of windows or sources of artificial light.</p>

<p>While they were lingering over the Messianic inscriptions
they suddenly awoke to the fact that the synagogue
was becoming thronged and that the summoning trumpets
were about concluding their sonorous chant. So they
made their way back, as rapidly as the incoming stream of
belated worshippers (not wholly unknown in any age)
would allow, to the seats which had been shown them.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Amen</span>, sang the trumpets in long-drawn note from
their tower. <span class="smcap">Amen</span>, answered the packed multitudes on
their knees. The door at the side of the platform
opened; and the seventy elders, with Alexander and
another younger man, who strongly resembled him, at
their head, entered in long flowing robes elaborately
fringed and decorated on the breast with phylacteries
lettered in gold. The leaders ascended the platform:
the others passed on to the gilded chairs. The Alabarch
seated himself under the canopy: his companion advanced
to the lecturn, bowed his head upon it for a moment, then
placed the <i>tulith</i> on his head—and at once the service
began.</p>

<p>Began with a doxology—spontaneous, universal,
mighty; flooding the whole temple with rhythmic billows
of uplifting sound. As the last note died away, the man
at the desk began to read from a roll that vivid picture of
the consequences to Israel of both obedience and disobedience
contained in Deut. 28th—read them sonorously
and with great distinctness, but not without something of
the artificial and professional in his tone—read them with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[64]</a></span>
here and there a word of comment which did not always
content itself with the literal sense instead of an allegorical
and mystical one. This reading concluded, he waved
a small flag; and all the people broke out again into a
doxology—this time the entire psalm, beginning with,
“Praise ye the Lord; praise the Lord, O my soul; while
I live will I praise the Lord,” in a rapid and triumphant
march of unified sound. He then proceeded to read on
his knees, the people all kneeling, the prayer contained
in the psalm that begins with “Give ear, O shepherd of
Israel, thou that leadest Joseph like a flock, thou that
dwellest between the cherubims shine forth;” at the conclusion
of which he waved the flag again and a universal
<span class="smcap">Amen</span> arose. This was followed by readings from the
prophets of selections commonly understood to point to
the Messiah. Again the flag waved, and the people exclaimed
as with one voice, but in a plaintive tone:</p>

<p>“Though he tarry long he will surely come.”</p>

<p>The reader then became a preacher. His theme was
the Messiah. He spoke of the certainty of His coming,
of the time and other circumstances of it, of the character
and functions that would belong to Him, of the way in
which He would prove Himself, and of the universal current
expectation of Him among their own people. He
showed that from the beginning of the race hints of Him
had been given—hints that gradually enlarged and brightened
as the ages rolled on, until, in the later prophets, all
veils were removed and the dimmest eye could see the
King that cometh in the name of the Lord. As to the
time—he shared the common belief of the present and
the last generation that the time was near, if not already
arrived. How could the dates of Daniel be reconciled<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[65]</a></span>
with any other view? To be sure, some allowance should
be made for round numbers: it would not do to say that
this or the next year is the time for the Coming; but
after all it is safe to say in a general way that we are living
in the times of the Christ. It ought not to surprise
them if He should come to-morrow. As to the family
from which He is to spring, the place of His birth, the
forerunner Elias He is to have, there is and can be but
one opinion. Exactly how He will prove himself to the
people it were hard to say: perhaps by a supernatural
beauty and glory of person, perhaps by a mysterious inward
voice speaking to the whole nation as it spoke to
individual prophets, perhaps only by His wonderful success
over all obstacles in becoming our Redeemer and
King.</p>

<p>The preacher evidently did not deem it wise to be at
all specific on this last point—the conquering and kingly
character of the Messiah—in a city held by the Romans
for the Cæsars. He contented himself with glittering
generalities. He spoke ornately and enthusiastically of
the prosperity and felicity of Israel in the golden age that
was sure to come. What the Gentiles call by that name
was a poor thing compared with that which was knocking
at the doors of the Chosen People.</p>

<p>He, however, cautioned his hearers not to allow themselves
to be impatient in their waiting for this good time.
Their faith might be tried. They must be on their guard
against pretenders. It would not be strange if the current
expectation should itself produce false Christs. It
would seem indeed as if this had already happened. At
this moment, as most of them knew, there was a man in
Judea who was making much noise with his claims, but<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[66]</a></span>
whom the principal men of the nation did not feel able to
accept. When the true Messiah comes he doubtless will
commend Himself to the natural leaders of the people.
Meanwhile the people should rest quietly in their various
places and occupations.</p>

<p>When the orator had finished, the Alabarch rose and
gave the usual invitation to approved persons to speak—immediately
adding, however, that he saw that one of
their own elders, Simeon the son of Simeon, had returned
from Jerusalem, and that whatever account he could give
of religious matters there would be acceptable.</p>

<p>A venerable looking man rose from among the Seventy.
He brought salutations from the Sanhedrin at
Jerusalem. They had been much disturbed over the case
of Jesus of Nazareth to whom the preacher had just referred.
The multitude were disposed to listen to him;
attributing to him many signs and wonders, and asking
whether he is not the Messiah. It was not clear, however,
that he himself had put forward any such claim. His
Messiahship seemed to be merely an inference of the multitude
from his wonderful works at a time when all are
on the lookout for the Shiloh. As to the reality of these
wonderful works, the brethren of the Great Council and
the principal men generally do not seem to call it in
question. They concede that Jesus has, with a word or a
touch, cured all sorts of incurable diseases; given sight
to the blind, hearing to the deaf, wholeness to the maimed,
reason to the insane, and even life to the dead. Two of
them, Joseph of Arimathea, and Nicodemus, a cousin of
the great teacher Gamaliel, go further than this, and affirm
that no man could do such mighty works unless God
were with him. “If such deeds could not prove a Divine<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[67]</a></span>
mission, they were at a loss to see how such a mission
could ever be proved. How was Moses authenticated?”
But the rest agree in ascribing the marvels to magic and
evil spirits; especially as there never has been known a
time when so many people seemed possessed with demons.
They say that they are compelled to resort to this explanation,
not merely by the fact that Jesus speaks so unfavorably
of the ecclesiastical authorities and of their oral
traditions, but still more by the fact that he does not
answer in origin, appearance, or aims to the Messiah.
The Messiah comes from Bethlehem, Jesus from Nazareth:
the Messiah comes from the royal family of David,
Jesus from a peasant family of no property or social
standing; the Messiah is a mighty King and Deliverer,
Jesus is plain in his appearance, associates even with
publicans and sinners, and has nothing of the warrior
and statesman about him—in fact, says that his kingdom
is not of this world. He has even been understood to
give out that his mission here is to teach and suffer rather
than to conquer and reign. Such a person differs so
widely from what they have been accustomed to expect
and from what the Sacred Books have been supposed to
promise, that the leading brethren in Judea, with the
exceptions mentioned, are unanimous in ascribing the
miracles of Jesus to the Evil One, and in trying to break
his influence with the people. Whether they will succeed
seems doubtful. But their determination to do so is very
strong and will probably lead to severe measures. He was
sorry not to be able to judge of the man from personal
observation; but Jesus at the time was in Galilee, and
could not be reached in the time at command. Besides,
it was evident that a visit of Simeon to Jesus would be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[68]</a></span>
looked upon as a discourtesy by the chief men—so decided
have their views become, and so high runs the tide of
feeling.</p>

<p>Such in a few words was the purport of what Simeon
said in more.</p>

<p>The reading of the psalm beginning, “Give the king
thy judgments O God, and thy righteousness to the king’s
son;” the waving of the flag; <span class="smcap">Amen</span> and <span class="smcap">Amen</span> by the
people, as with one voice, concluded the service.</p>

<p>The congregation rapidly disappeared through the
many doors that suddenly revealed themselves; for the
architect had thought it possible that occasion might arise
for a hasty evacuation of the premises—had also thought
it possible to have the means of egress as unnoticeable by
a stranger as were the means of light. But a few of the
elders, among whom were Alexander and the preacher,
gathered about Simeon, whose chair stood near the
daughter of Alexander. Cimon and Aleph had also lingered;
it may be with the idea of making some inquiry
of Simeon or the preacher. Seeing this, the Alabarch
beckoned them near, and, simply introducing them as
co-religionists, proceeded to say to Simeon:</p>

<p>“I am sorry that you were not able to see and hear
Jesus for yourself.”</p>

<p>“My desire was strong to do so: and I did my best to
get as near as possible to personal observation. I sought
reliable information from all quarters. There seemed to
be no difference of opinion, even among his greatest enemies,
as to the reality of his miracles.”</p>

<p>“What do you understand,” inquired another elder,
“to be the general character of his teaching? How does
he treat our Sacred Writings?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[69]</a></span></p>

<p>“With the highest honor. It is agreed on all hands
that no word has fallen from him that savors of irreverence
toward the Law and the Prophets: on the contrary,
he makes them final authorities on all matters of which
they speak; and when he rebukes the leaders of the people
it is in their name. He does not belong to the synagogue
of Malus.”</p>

<p>“That is a great point in his favor,” said another.
“But are his own manners and morals blameless in the
view of the Law?”</p>

<p>“I must confess that I heard nothing to the contrary—not
being able myself to see wrong in a religious
teacher eating and drinking like other people, or in his
being accessible to the lowly and sinful.”</p>

<p>“Have not I heard you say, brother Philo,” said
Alexander to the preacher, “that the chiefs of the people
charge Jesus with blasphemy? Blasphemy can hardly
be considered a point of good behavior.”</p>

<p>“I spake as I heard,” said Philo. “Perhaps Simeon
can tell us whether I heard correctly.”</p>

<p>“It seems,” said Simeon, “that Jesus has sometimes
spoken of himself as the Son of God; and, in a mysterious
way, of a certain unity between himself and his heavenly
Father; and, probably, it is this lofty way of speaking of
himself which has given occasion for the charge of which
you speak.”</p>

<p>“Do not the prophets sometimes use language equally
strong about the Christ?” asked Cimon deferentially.</p>

<p>“For example,” said Aleph: “His name shall be
called Wonderful, counsellor, the mighty God, the everlasting
Father.”</p>

<p>“Such passages, I believe, have always been understood<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[70]</a></span>
by many among us as declaring that the Christ will
not be a mere man, but will have something of a Divine
quality about him,” said Alexander reflectively.</p>

<p>“Perhaps, then,” added Cimon, “it is not so much
the magnificence of the claims of Jesus that has led the
fathers at Jerusalem to view him as a blasphemer, but
rather the striking contrast between such claims and the
humble appearance and circumstances of him who makes
them, and which have already led them to decide against
him. Of course, if he is not the Christ, such lofty pretensions
are blasphemous—not otherwise.”</p>

<p>“But it appears to me,” said another elder, Ben
Abner, whose dress was specially showy, phylacteries
specially many, and air specially haughty, “that the
humble condition of the man is itself decisive against
him. Our wise men, for generations, have understood
from the Scriptures that the Messiah would appear in
great splendor as a conqueror and king. For my part I
expect no other Messiah, want no other, will have no
other. I hope they of Jerusalem will away with the impostor.”
He spoke with flashing eyes.</p>

<p>“So <em>I</em> think,” said half a dozen voices with emphasis
and gesture.</p>

<p>“Possibly the friends of Jesus would say,” returned
Simeon coolly, “that great endings sometimes have small
beginnings, and that there is time enough yet for the outward
splendor. Indeed, I happen to know that this is
what some of his friends do say. But others claim, and
I must confess that this is what Jesus himself seems to
teach, that the prophets have been misunderstood; that
the kingdom and the glory and the conquests of which
they speak are spiritual and so perfectly consistent with a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[71]</a></span>
lowly and even suffering Messiah. And for evidence they
appeal to the prophecies of Isaiah, and other Scriptures.
Perhaps our friend Philo, who believes so thoroughly in
the allegoric and spiritual meanings of our Sacred Books,
will not blame this interpretation as severely as some do.”</p>

<p>Philo smiled at this, and said that he never intended
to spiritualize <em>away</em> the Scriptures. It would be very
hard for him to give up the brilliant hopes that had so
long been entertained as to the times of the Messiah and
what he would do for his Israel.</p>

<p>“I should not have so much difficulty,” said Alexander,
“with the present humble condition of Jesus, and
the spiritual character of his claims, as with the apparent
fact that he was not born in Bethlehem and is not a son
of David—as the Messiah must be.”</p>

<p>“That has been my great difficulty,” said Simeon.
“It is everywhere claimed in Judea that Jesus is a Galilean,
a Nazarene, and of parentage so humble that he is
on that account in disfavor with even the people of
Nazareth.”</p>

<p>Aleph ventured to inquire whether some branches of
David’s line had not, in the course of centuries, sunk into
a humble condition; and whether it was not possible that
Jesus belonged to some such decayed branch—also,
whether he might not have been born in Bethlehem,
though brought up elsewhere?</p>

<p>“I think,” said Simeon, “that we are hardly entitled
to say <i>No</i> to either of these questions of the young man.
I myself was born in Jerusalem, though brought up in
this city. The family of David is now lost among the
common people; and, though it can be recovered in our
genealogies, I never could learn that the enemies of Jesus<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[72]</a></span>
have taken the pains to examine them with reference to
his claims. Having settled in their minds that such a
Messiah as Jesus is neither what they expected nor wanted,
they easily accepted without examination such rumors in
regard to him as agreed with their wishes and foregone
conclusion. So, at least, it seems to me.”</p>

<p>“Can you tell us about what the age of Jesus is?”
asked Cimon.</p>

<p>“He appears, I am told, somewhat less than forty;
perhaps he is not much more than thirty years. I took
special pains to inquire about this; partly because of an
experience of my father’s some thirty years ago, and partly
because of wide-spread rumors at that time of a remarkable
birth which had just taken place in connection with
celestial phenomena. However, the matter was kept as
close as possible from fear of Herod. My father at that
time was living in Jerusalem—a very old man and as
saintly as old. For a long while he had expressed to his
family an assurance that he should live to see the Christ.
One day he came home from the temple with a radiant face,
saying that he was now ready to depart, for he had just
seen and held in his arms an infant which an inward
Divine voice told him was the Messiah. He then lay
down, calmly closed his eyes, and departed in a peaceful
sleep. This I had from my sister, for I was in Alexandria
at the time. All this was widely known at the time, but
was spoken of by the people under their breath on account
of the jealousy and cruelty of the rulers. Now at that
time Jesus must have been an infant.”</p>

<p>“And we happen to know,” said Aleph, looking at
Cimon, “that the name of the infant concerning whom
such remarkable things were told was Jesus—though we<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[73]</a></span>
may not at present tell how we came by the knowledge.”</p>

<p>As Aleph said these words he could not well help
noticing three things—the cordial look that Simeon gave
him, the look of exasperation on the face of Ben Abner,
and the start made by Rachel, whose attitude of earnest
attention throughout the conversation would have been
evident enough even if her veil had not been gradually
drawn somewhat aside as she watched the speakers.
Alexander also noticed the start. Perhaps he feared a
return of yesterday’s faintness. He bent over her, and
spoke in a low tone. She shook her head.</p>

<p>“However, we will go home,” said he, “as soon as I
have put off these vestments.”</p>

<p>He retired to the vestry, followed by the other elders.</p>

<p>Aleph approached the maiden and said that he had
been glad to hear from her father that her nurse continued
to mend, and expressed the hope that she herself
was none the worse for her indisposition of yesterday.</p>

<p>“Not at all,” said she promptly; “but I was absorbingly
interested in the subject of the conversation, and
was, I confess, startled by what you said of your knowledge
of the infant Jesus. You were not then born.”</p>

<p>“No, lady; my knowledge is altogether second-hand,
but is none the less certain for that. My friend here has
some original knowledge in the case; but both of us have,
in addition to this, sources of information that are beyond
all question.”</p>

<p>“I very much fear,” said she with a sigh, “when I
hear Ben Abner and others, that our people will be found
treating a new prophet as they have ever treated prophets.
What do you think?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[74]</a></span></p>

<p>“I also have my fears.”</p>

<p>“But you also have knowledge; and if at any time it
becomes consistent for you to share your knowledge with
others none will welcome it more gladly than I. Till then
I believe in it and—in you”—and her eyes, which till then
had been unconsciously and half-wonderingly perusing
his face as she spoke, sank before his, and the lovely color
deepened on the loveliest features that the Chaldean, or
even the more experienced Greek, had ever seen.</p>

<p>What was that? A confused sound as of struggle and
disputing voices came from the direction of the great door
on the street of Canopus. This was soon followed by the
noisy tramp on the marble pavement of what seemed in
the distance a body of soldiers. As they came nearer
they were seen to be indeed some twelve Roman soldiers
in full armor, carrying at their head a standard—the legionary
standard, consisting of a pike surmounted by a
silver eagle, on whose spread wings stood an effigy of the
emperor, with this superscription in large capitals—<span class="smcap">Deus
Tiberius Cæsar</span>.</p>

<p>The soldiers were followed at a short distance by a
weeping, groaning, threatening crowd of Jews who had
tried, it would seem, to prevent the entrance of the party
with their desecrating symbol, and were now following
them with lamentations and execrations.</p>

<p>As the band came near, Aleph easily recognized in the
leader of it the drunken officer whom he had disarmed on
the Nile. Almost as soon the two friends were recognized
by the Roman; and, with an oath, he at once led the way
to where they stood (they had planted themselves in
front of Rachel), although at that moment Alexander and
his elders were hastily coming forward from the vestry.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[75]</a></span></p>

<p>“I have found you at last,” the man cried, as he disposed
his soldiers in a semicircle, “and you will not easily
escape me.”</p>

<p>Alexander had now come up.</p>

<p>“As the head of the community worshipping here, I
demand to know for what purpose you have come into
their sanctuary with standard and arms?”</p>

<p>“To give you and your friends,” the officer replied
with mock solemnity, “an opportunity, which no doubt
you will gratefully accept, to pay an act of religious worship
to the great god Tiberius Cæsar—after this manner,”
and he kneeled before the standard, and, with both hands
lifted, cried, <i>Great God, I worship thee</i>.</p>

<p>Rising, he exclaimed, “Now I have set you an example—copy
it, every one of you!”</p>

<p>The crowd behind groaned and hissed.</p>

<p>The officer shook his fist at them and shouted, “Be
still, you snakes and swine; your turn will come shortly.
Let your betters lead off. It is their privilege. Come,
begin, Pontifex Maximus!”—turning to Alexander.</p>

<p>“I demand of you by what authority you make this
demand on us,” demanded the Alabarch.</p>

<p>The Roman pointed to the image of the emperor.</p>

<p>“Do you mean to say that an order has come from
Rome for violating the sanctuaries of the Jews, and revoking
the edicts which from the founding of the city have
guaranteed to us our own religious views and usages?”</p>

<p>“The Roman senate has decreed Divine honors to the
emperor; and his image has been received and worshipped
in every place of worship in the city, saving the synagogues
of the Jews. Now you shall have your turn.”</p>

<p>“That is no answer to my question. The Jews have<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[76]</a></span>
always had special privileges in this city, and one of them
is to refuse worship to every god but their own. Again I
ask, has this privilege been recalled by the emperor since
yesterday: for yesterday I received a personal letter from
him in which he promised to abate nothing from our
privileges.”</p>

<p>The Roman made no answer, but conferred with one
of his men in a low voice. After a moment’s delay, Alexander
continued:</p>

<p>“It is plain that you have no authority from the emperor
for this outrage. Have you for it the authority of
the governor, or of the prefect of the city? I await your
careful reply.”</p>

<p>“We are carrying out the wishes of the representatives
of Rome in Alexandria,” said the fellow sullenly.</p>

<p>“And <em>that</em> is no answer to my question. Are we to
understand that Avilleus Flaccus, or Urbanus Civicus, undertakes
on his own responsibility to set aside the decrees
of kings and emperors for four hundred years, those of
the reigning emperor included, and has expressly sent
you here to-day for this purpose?”</p>

<p>“We did not come here,” said the officer with a face
that was fast becoming purple, “to be catechised.”</p>

<p>“You came here,” said Alexander sternly, “to commit
an outrage—came as a private venture of yourself and
a few mischievous companions, and without authority
from your superiors. You deserve heavy punishment, and
I hope will get it. Now <em>begone</em> from the sanctuary which
you have profaned.”</p>

<p>“<em>Begone!</em>” echoed the elders. “<span class="smcap">Begone!</span>” shouted
and screamed the mob from behind.</p>

<p>“Whatever privileges you cursed Jews may have, they<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[77]</a></span>
certainly do not belong to these men”—pointing at Cimon
and Aleph. “These are no more Jews than I am. And
for aught I know the same is true of this woman. We
will see”—and he stepped toward Rachel to lift her veil.</p>

<p>“Stand back,” said Aleph sternly, as he placed his
hand on the breast of the man and sent him staggering
back on his men.</p>

<p>Before the man could recover himself, Alexander
interfered: “This lady is my daughter; and as for these
men, they are of our faith, and as co-religionists are entitled
to our immunities.”</p>

<p>“And if it were not so,” said Aleph, “it may be well
for this man to know that under no conceivable circumstances
would we pay religious worship to the emperor,
though quite ready to pay the magistrates all due observance.”</p>

<p>“We will see,” cried the Roman in a transport of fury,
as he rushed on the young man with his drawn sword.
“Down on your knees to the standard this instant, you
renegade, or by Jupiter, I will put you on your knees for
the rest of your life,” and he struck at his knees.</p>

<p>Aleph caught the blow with his cane. Whereupon the
officer lost all self-restraint and made a rapid succession
of strokes and thrusts that sought life. But Aleph had
evidently learned the art of fence: his cane was as good
as a shield and met the sword at every point. At last,
after a desperate lunge, the sword went flying aloft; and
both Cimon and Aleph had seized its master.</p>

<p>“<span class="smcap">Expel Them!</span>” shouted Alexander to the crowd of
Jews that was now surging and roaring like a maddened
sea, “Expel them with your canes and your hands! They
have forced an entrance into our sanctuary, they have profaned<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[78]</a></span>
it with an idol, and now they have sought to stain
it with the blood of unarmed men. <span class="smcap">Expel them</span>, I say!”</p>

<p>The mob needed no spur. They threw themselves on
the soldiers, already cowed by what had passed, and in a
moment were dragging them, disarmed and unresisting,
behind Cimon and Aleph with their prisoner. Had it
not been for the example of coolness and forbearance set
by our friends and an occasional moderating word from
them, the people might have torn their prisoners limb from
limb. As it was, the soldiers had no gentle handling. They
had little armor left on them when they reached the great
doors. They had gotten many an accidental elbowing
and tripping. Somehow people had stumbled heavily
and found it hard to recover themselves. There were
few parts of those Roman bodies which had not become
intimately acquainted with both the point and broadside
of a cane. Their captain suffered least—in fact, suffered
nothing beyond the shame and uneasiness of being held
fast in iron hands.</p>

<p>When those hands were taken off, just outside the
great door, he suddenly drew a knife from a fold in his
sash and made a pass at Aleph. But both friends were
vigilant; and Cimon, while beating off the knife with one
hand, with the other dealt the rascal such a blow on the
head that his helmet flew off and went clattering down
the steps into the street. He followed staggering. The
people behind, seeing only the cuff and the result, cheered,
and very cheerfully followed the example supposed to be
set them. Each soldier received such a hearty cuff and
push as he went down the steps as made his descent little
less than a fall.</p>

<p>Once down, they were not allowed to linger. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[79]</a></span>
blood of the people was up; and they followed the soldiers
in their precipitate flight a long distance with menacing
cries and gestures, and with such missiles as they happened
to find in the street.</p>

<p>Meanwhile the friends had been called within the synagogue
by Alexander, and the great doors fastened. What
consultations took place it is not necessary to record.
There <em>were</em> consultations; and that too of a very political
and secular sort. The situation of the Jews was always
delicate. There was much reason to fear that the morning’s
disturbance would seriously embroil them with the
authorities at both Alexandria and Rome. What should
be done? If any one has light let him speak out at once—<em>though
it be Sabbath</em>.</p>

<p>But none had scruples. The ideas of the Alexandrian
Jews of the first century were not exactly like those of
some of their ancestors in the time of the Maccabees who
refused to defend themselves against their enemies on the
Sabbath because self-defense was work, and that too of
the severest sort. The children had become wiser if not
better. They had come to believe that self-preservation
is a work of necessity, not to say of mercy; and were
ready to fight the idolaters seven days in the week if necessary
for even a less matter than self-preservation—as we
have seen. They would not consent to be martyrs till
they had tried hard to be victors. They would not be
idolaters, and they did not want to be rebels. They
wanted to preserve their religion, and also wanted to preserve
themselves. Was it possible? <i>Let us see</i>, said the
Seventy, as they resumed their gilded chairs. So the men
who did not hesitate to fight a battle on the Sabbath did
not scruple to consult on that day how to prevent the battle<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[80]</a></span>
from souring into a defeat. Were they wrong in
this?</p>

<p>Cimon and Aleph answered in the negative. I am not
sure but that I agree with them. Doubtless a council of
war <em>may</em> be as holy as a prayer-meeting. I once knew of
one that was holier, but that began with a prayer.</p>

<p>But a narrative is like a star—it perishes if it stops
moving. So let us proceed.</p>

<h3>V.<br />
<span class="smaller">THE UNIVERSITY.</span></h3>

<p>Early the next morning Cimon and Aleph transferred
themselves and their effects to a small khan
in the Egyptian quarter of the city. This was done for
the following reasons.</p>

<p>The events of the Sabbath seemed to make it prudent
to withdraw from public notice as much as possible. Of
course, the son of Flaccus was a source of danger: and
then the seeming look of recognition on the face of
Malus, which both of them had noticed, was not a pleasant
feature of the situation. It was the silent lightning
on the horizon. They felt it even more important, just
then, to keep out of the sight of the Jew than it was to
keep out of the sight of the Roman. Especially after an
incident that occurred on their way back from the synagogue.</p>

<p>As they came down the steps of the Diapleuston, they
noticed a Jew across the street, watching them. Before
they had gone far, Aleph, happening to look behind, saw
the man following, and spoke of it to Cimon. They
walked slower—at length very slowly. The man slackened
his pace to suit. They walked faster—at length
very fast. The man quickened his pace correspondingly.
It was annoying.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[84]</a></span></p>

<p>“Let us go to meet him,” said Cimon, “and see if he
will retreat.”</p>

<p>Accordingly they turned and, for a moment, it seemed
as if their shadow would turn too. But he thought better
of it; and only stood still, in some confusion, till they
came up.</p>

<p>“Can we do anything for you?” inquired the Greek.
“If so we are at your service.”</p>

<p>“I certainly owe you an apology,” stammered the
Jew. “The fact is, I was in the synagogue at the time
of the disturbance, and was so struck with the very great
likeness of this young man to one whom I saw many years
ago that I determined to wait for his coming out and to
follow him—in hope of finding where he was staying,
or at least of getting a better view. And I have gotten
it,” he added laughingly, “in a way I did not
expect, but certainly deserved. However, I will not
complain; as I now have an opportunity to thank you
both for standing up so boldly and effectually for us
to-day.”</p>

<p>“Well,” said Cimon, good-humoredly, “since we have
now gratified your curiosity, perhaps you will not refuse
to gratify ours by telling us who you are, and whom you
suppose this young man to resemble.”</p>

<p>“That is but fair,” returned the Jew. “I keep a
khan at the east end of this street, near the gate of Canopus,
as did my father before me. When I was a youth,
there came to our place from Judea a caravan of eastern
people, evidently of great distinction, on their way homeward
by the Red Sea route. It was in this company that
I saw a man whose appearance made such an impression
on me that if I were a painter I could put him on canvas<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[85]</a></span>
to-day: and this young man is his double—perhaps somewhat
brightened by youth.”</p>

<p>“I have to confess,” said Aleph with a smile, “that
I am a Chaldean; and also that all Chaldeans have a certain
likeness to one another. But you must not forget
that the imagination is a powerful faculty, especially
among us orientals, and has sometimes been known to see
things that did not exist. But you can see for yourself,
without any help from your imagination, that the peculiar
way in which this conference has come about has attracted
the notice of the street, and that the curious are beginning
to thicken about us. So now let us separate: but, as soon
as our affairs permit, we will seek you out and hear further
about the pilgrims of whom you speak.”</p>

<p>So they parted. But the incident, especially after reflection
and conference early the next morning, determined
the friends to withdraw as fully as possible from
the Jewish and Roman quarters of the city, and to hasten
certain inquiries as to Malus.</p>

<p>There are two kinds of prophecy—the natural and the
supernatural. The latter is a spark from the Divine foreknowledge,
granted occasionally to certain privileged persons.
That our friends had anything of this I am not
prepared to say; but they were reasonably well furnished
with such foresight as reason and experience can give;
and what they foresaw was very considerable annoyance
and even danger if they should remain at their present
quarters. So they determined to remove. This was not
valor, certainly. As certainly it was not cowardice. But
it was that good thing which we call prudence, and which
sensible people think to be almost or quite as good as heroism
itself. It was a wise precaution—the tacking of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[86]</a></span>
ship when breakers are seen ahead, the putting on of
armor when the arrows begin to fly, the striking tent and
removing to higher ground when the morning sky is red
and lowering, and there is a sound of abundance of rain.</p>

<p>Have I said that the strangers were in the habit of
asking each morning for Divine guidance during the
day? If not, I ought to have said it. And the habit was
no empty form. When they had risen from their knees
they seemed free from anxiety as to what might happen,
though not free from forethought and a disposition to be
very active in pursuit of their objects. Queer people, were
they not? Some would say they were very absurd as well
as queer. However this may be, it is certain that Aleph
and his friend did not stir a step that morning even in
the matter of planning, till they had sought leading from
a wisdom above their own. And what they did that
morning they may be counted on to do every morning
while we follow their fortunes. Will it be of any service
to them? Perhaps they have found in their Septuagint
several passages like this, “Commit thy way unto the
Lord and he shall direct thy paths.”</p>

<p>Perhaps Cimon found more difficulty than his young
companion in keeping free from anxiety on account of
what had occurred. He felt a responsibility for both.</p>

<p>“It seems unfortunate,” said he, after their devotions,
“not only that we should have been brought again into
collision with the Romans, who can do so much to hinder
at least one of our objects, but that it has come about in
such a way as to attract to us the notice of the whole
Jewish community. For, of course, yesterday’s events
will be public talk to-day, and everybody will be inquiring
and surmising about the strangers. And I am very<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[87]</a></span>
much afraid that Malus has already caught a spark that
in such a gale will set all his suspicions and craft on fire.
But as these seemingly untoward things could not well
have been avoided by us, I cannot but hope that the untowardness
is only in seeming. I have lived long enough
to know that a Divine leading can brighten seeming perils
and disasters into blessings. But it seems a reasonable
condition of Divine guidance that we try to act as prudently
as we can, from the human stand-point. And
prudence seems to require that we at once remove to the
Egyptian quarter; that you matriculate in the University,
and thus secure its immunities for yourself, as well as meet
the wishes of your father that you hear for yourself the
scholars of the west; and that I proceed without delay to
make the inquiries we need to make in regard to Malus.
These inquiries will have to be made as quietly and rapidly
as possible; for if he should take the alarm his craft and
influence are evidently such that he might seriously embarrass
our movements—if not baffle them.”</p>

<p>And so it came to pass that the early morning found
them established in a quiet khan almost under the shadow
of the Serapeum.</p>

<p>This does not localize them very definitely; for the
Serapeum cast a very great shadow. The temple, or
rather collection of temples, was, by all odds, the most imposing
structure in Alexandria. It was built on an elevation,
partly artificial, the ascent to which on three sides
was by broad flights of steps and successive platforms;
while on the north side the ascent began at the harbor
and advanced by a grade easy for vehicles to the great
Propylon. This was purely Egyptian. To the right and
left of it rose walls of red syenite, high and massive enough<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[88]</a></span>
to be the walls of a city, decorated with many towers, and
inclosing the whole levelled summit of the hill with their
somewhat irregular lines. Within these, at a little distance,
and built of the same, though much finer and carefully
wrought, stone, rose the complicate structures of the
temple proper. It was a little city by itself. And, towering
above all other structures, it seemed to protect Alexandria
and defy the seas beyond.</p>

<p>Like most Egyptian structures it was most successful
in giving to beholders the ideas of massiveness and vastness.
Yet the airiness of the situation, combined with a
mingling of the various Hellenic architectures with the
Egyptian, seemed to relieve the ponderous pile of any air
of heaviness. For Pharaohs and Ptolemies, Mother Isis
and her vagrant daughters Doris and Ione and Cora,
were all represented in the confused mass of templed
structures designed to welcome all the classical creeds.</p>

<p>The most striking features of the temple, to one looking
up to it from the street, were, perhaps, an enormous
canopy that seemed to overhang the whole pile of buildings
and a tower by its side that rose still higher. This
tower was the famous observatory where Eratosthenes and
Hipparchus had made their observations; and in the
spacious halls at its base was deposited the greater part of
the then existing Alexandrian library—consisting of some
200,000 works collected by the Ptolemies, together with
300,000 parchments brought from Pergamos by Mark
Antony for Cleopatra.</p>

<p>The Serapeum was under Egyptian control, but was
greatly revered by devout Greeks and Romans as well as
by Egyptians. Each nation regarded the god to whom
the temple was dedicated and whose statue of mingled<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[89]</a></span>
marble and silver and gold was there enshrined, as being
the chief of all its gods—the Egyptians calling it Osiris,
the Greeks Zeus, and the Romans Jupiter. For some
reason, of late years, this statue had been kept in a dark
room, and was seldom, if ever, shown to the people at
large. They worshipped without the presence of any visible
symbol of deity. The priests were numerous and of
the highest rank. The chief of all was primate of all
Egypt.</p>

<p>To its religious character the Serapeum added that of
an institution of learning. Its priests had among their
own people the reputation for wisdom which belonged to
the ancient Egyptian priesthood among all nations—and
not without reason. Their priestly duties being light,
they spent much time in studying the sciences and philosophies
as then known, and in training young priests to
the same. In addition, the more eminent among them
taught on certain topics in the Alexandrian School. They
were recognized by the Ptolemies, and afterward by the
emperors, as in all respects peers of the teachers located
at the Museum.</p>

<p>Indeed, among people religiously inclined their standing
was altogether superior to that of the secular professors.
They were far more sober and practical in their
teachings. They more boldly recognized religion and
taught on lines parallel with it. They had stricter notions
of what could properly be called science and philosophy.
A few facts blown up into prettily colored bubbles,
and then tossed into the air on exhibition, and then collapsing,
and then succeeded by another output of pretty
emptinesses, and this by another, and so on—such were the
substance and history of the better part of the ever-changing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[90]</a></span>
teaching of the Museum. The worse part had no
foundation in facts at all. In fact, facts were scorned.
They were vulgar. The lofty name of wisdom should be
given only to great general intuitions and the logical deductions
from them. And as the teachers were by no
means careful in either their premises or their processes,
their conclusions were apt to be worthless when they were
not pernicious. In short, the Museum was the child of
Athens and the mother of Germany.</p>

<p>Accordingly, many of the noblest families in the neighboring
countries turned their faces toward the Serapeum.
They were disgusted at the laborious trifling. They were
alarmed at the decay of faith. If their sons could not
have something that deserved to be called knowledge, and
knowledge without impiety and all the terrors, they did
not want them to have it at all. But if they could have it
thoroughly leavened with religious ideas—why, they would
welcome it, be very glad of it, pour out for it their shekels
or sestertii or staters freely. Such people found what
they wanted in the priest-teachers of the Serapeum; and
said to themselves that if religion is the supreme wisdom
then are the ministers of religion the supreme professors.</p>

<p>All this Cimon recalled and spoke of when he found
himself in the neighborhood of the temple. And he proposed
that Aleph should matriculate there instead of at
the Museum—as being the nearer and more conservative
branch of the University, as well as more remote from
the Roman headquarters.</p>

<p>“I do not think,” said he, “that you will need to
confine yourself very closely to the routine of lectures.
Many of the more advanced students do not. You are
already familiar through me with the main subjects discussed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[91]</a></span>
in both the Athenian and Alexandrian Schools:
and I do not imagine that you will hear much that is
new; only you will hear the old said in a new way, with
new illustrations and personal modifications, which is not
without its advantage to a young man. And you will
have what, perhaps, is a still greater advantage, that of
mingling with and studying the leading young men of
the West. As to the present preliminaries for admission
to the School, you had better apply to Seti for information.”</p>

<p>“And why not ask his advice, also,” said Aleph, “as
to how you had better proceed in the affair of Malus? It
would be a safe thing to do. The priest is not in love
with the trader.”</p>

<p>“Perhaps,” returned the Greek, “this is the best
thing to be done. Still I feel reluctant to do it—at least
till I have proved it necessary. It is a good rule not to
call on others to help you till you have tried to help yourself.
We must spare our friends as much as possible.
And I do not see that any harm can be done by my going
directly to the custom house and inquiring on what terms
abstracts from the records can be made, or by my going
to leading dealers and asking how the prices of certain
goods have ruled in Alexandria for a term of years. Let
me cautiously feel my way about to-day by myself: by the
evening I shall be better able to see whether we need to
call in help from outside.”</p>

<p>As soon as Cimon had gone, Aleph inquired of the
landlord at what part of the temple he should present
himself. Climbing successive flights of steps that began
almost at the khan, he came to the broad carriage-way of
which we have spoken. As yet very few people could be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[92]</a></span>
seen upon it—none who seemed moving to the temple.
This led him to think that very likely he was yet too early
for the temple habits, and had better linger a little before
seeking admittance. So he sat down on one of the stone
seats, placed at intervals by the wayside for the convenience
of the weary and the idle, and proceeded to study at
his leisure the stately façade of the temple. While thus
engaged he heard voices just back of the wall against
which he was leaning.</p>

<p>A voice laughed heartily.</p>

<p>“Have you been at your cups so early” said another
voice testily. “I should have thought that these leeks
and onions would set you to crying. That is what they
do to me.”</p>

<p>“I couldn’t cry if I were up to my eyes in the onions
of Nauticratis,” said the other. “Oh, it was such a capital
thing! Why, the very gods themselves must be shaking
with laughter—at least our Egyptian gods.”</p>

<p>“Who ever heard of an Egyptian god laughing? Our
deities never did that in the best days of the country.
They who were as grim as fate when Thebes was in its
glory are not likely to smile now when Thebes is dead,
and a Roman garrison is in Alexandria, and a Roman
Governor in the palace of Seti.”</p>

<p>“That is just it—now you are coming to the point!”
cried the other; “it is just <em>because</em> there is a Roman
garrison in Alexandria and a Roman Proprætor in the
ancestral palace of Seti that our gods, calm and grave as
they generally are, must have had a merry time of it
yesterday.”</p>

<p>“There, take that, you provoking Sphinx!” (and
Aleph heard something strike against the wall). “If you<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[93]</a></span>
do not expound your riddle right away it will be, not two
onions that your empty head will get, but a whole basket
of them.”</p>

<p>“Do you pretend to say that you have not heard what
took place yesterday at the Diapleuston? Why, the
whole city is ringing with it—at least the Jewish Quarter.
The Roman Quarter will be silent enough, I warrant.”</p>

<p>“Have heard nothing. Was in Canopus yesterday—came
back before people were stirring this morning.
What is it? Out with it, man!”</p>

<p>“An you be a true son of Egypt, now open your ears
and mouth! Yesterday the Governor took a hundred
soldiers and tried to make the Jews at the Diapleuston
worship an image of the emperor. A magnificent young
man in shining armor suddenly appeared on the scene,
disarmed Flaccus, and encouraged the Jews to give the
whole party a good drubbing. Which they did. The
Romans were pommelled within an inch of their lives,
then tumbled headlong into the street, and then chased
on a full run quite to Bruchium. Gods! what a treat to
see Flaccus run! I would have given ten years of my
life to see it. And now it is said that Alexander, the
favorite banker of the emperor, and heavier with him
than all the pyramids put together, has just written to
the governor demanding an apology for his behavior; and
threatening to report him to the emperor.”</p>

<p>“Give us your fist, old fellow! Here goes my cap—to
the moon, for aught I care. This <em>is</em> good news, capital
news, news fit for the gods, news—almost too good to be
true! But it <em>ought</em> to be true, and so true it must be.
Let the gods laugh till the skies crack. To see the
Romans soundly thrashed and running away with their<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[94]</a></span>
tails between their legs must have been a treat for heaven
and earth. I could give that young man a chaplet—who
is he?”</p>

<p>“Just what everybody is asking.”</p>

<p>“And just what, in my opinion, nobody will ever find
out; for he must have been at once rapturously spirited
off by the celestials to their own country for the good
service done us. Perhaps he was a celestial to begin with.”</p>

<p>“That reminds me that I did hear some Jews debating
whether he might not be the Wonderful Deliverer
whom they are expecting.”</p>

<p>Was there any danger that Aleph would be unduly
exalted in his own estimation by such a very complimentary
account of himself? Perhaps he was saved from this
peril by the several large exaggerations of the story. What
more natural than for him to say, “And I, too, am an
exaggeration!”</p>

<p>At any rate, he wasted no time in arguing the matter;
for he now noticed that the postern at the side of the
great gate was being opened to a comer. So he rose,
advanced leisurely to the postern, and plied the knocker
which hung from a small window above. The door
opened. He told the porter that he wished to see the
priest Seti.</p>

<p>“I suppose you mean the <em>high</em>-priest Seti!” said the
man with dignity.</p>

<p>“Very possibly,” said Aleph. “Is there here more
than one priest of that name?”</p>

<p>“I know of no other.”</p>

<p>“Then I wish to see the <em>high</em>-priest Seti. Please have
him informed that Aleph the Chaldean wishes to see
him.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[95]</a></span></p>

<p>The porter glanced outside, as if to see whether there
was any fine equipage, with servants, before the great
gateway: then said:</p>

<p>“You probably will not be able to see him this
morning. I doubt if he would see the prefect of the
city.”</p>

<p>“But I am <em>not</em> the prefect—as you have just seen. I
am a visitor more likely to be acceptable to the high-priest:
for I come by his express invitation. So I will
enter and stay in the hall till an answer comes to my
message”—and he advanced on the man with so decisive
and commanding an air that he gave way and admitted
him.</p>

<p>“Now if you will send my message at once, you will
do no more than your duty,” said Aleph coolly.</p>

<p>So a servant was sent off; who after a few moments
returned and, with an air of great respect, said, “The
high-priest will see you. I will conduct you to him.”
But he was spared the trouble, for just then Seti himself
appeared, received his visitor in a way that astonished the
servants, and conducted him to his own private rooms.</p>

<p>“You see,” said the young man with that modesty
and deference of manner that are so graceful and winning
in the young toward age and station, “that I have very
soon availed myself of your permission to call upon you.
It is the wish of my father that I should, while in Alexandria,
hear for myself the scholars of the west; though
the Greek preceptor, who has conducted my education
and whom you have seen, has already made me acquainted
in a general way with the western literature and learning
as it was taught in his youth, both here and at Athens.
And, as I am told that the Serapeum stands for a branch<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[96]</a></span>
of the Alexandrian School, I wish to join it here; and
have come to you to learn in what way I may do so, and
become entitled to such privileges and immunities as
membership confers.”</p>

<p>“I am glad that you propose doing this,” returned
the high-priest; “especially because I have heard from
Alexander of the events of yesterday. No doubt there is
danger abroad; but if any class among us is specially
exempt from espial and interference by the civil and military
authorities it is that of the students. So we will
have you booked without delay. Where are you now
lodged?”</p>

<p>On hearing of the transfer to his own neighborhood,
Seti added:</p>

<p>“That is just what I was about to propose. The
Romans have less to do with this part of the city than
with any other. Neither my son nor myself anticipate
any trouble from the authorities on account of what occurred
yesterday. They probably will disavow all connection
with it, on account of my son’s influence at Rome.
At the same time they, no doubt, are in full sympathy
with the rascals and will let them off without punishment,
if not with secret commendation. This everybody is sure
of—I mean everybody who knows that the leader in the
affair was the son of Flaccus. Your chief danger will be
from that reprobate. After the lessons he has had he is
not likely to attack you in front; but you will need to be
on your guard against all mean and dishonorable ways of
attack. He is the greatest scoundrel in Alexandria—after
his father and Malus, who have all his vices and hypocrisy
in addition. But come, let us lose no time in matriculating.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[97]</a></span></p>

<p>Seti then led the way to a large hall with a platform
and seats.</p>

<p>“This,” said he, “is our chief lecture-room; and here
some of the professors who live and lecture at the Museum
come at stated times to repeat their lectures. This door
opens into the tower from the top of which our astronomers
observe the stars; and sometimes other things nearer
home, as, for example, the flight and pursuit yesterday
along the street of Canopus. The doors on the other
three sides open into the library with its 500,000 different
works on papyrus and parchment. Let us pass
into it.”</p>

<p>Aleph now found himself in a room, or rather a suite
of rooms, lighted wholly from above, whose sides were
shining with the copper cylinders which contained the
literary treasures of many lands and centuries. What
would our modern bibliopoles not give for the same privilege?
At central tables and in recesses were scholars
poring over open rolls—also professional scribes copying
manuscripts with careful exactness and a beauty of result
wonderful to see. Seti led his companion freely within
the bronze railing that fenced the collection from the
general public; taking down and exhibiting some notably
rare or beautiful rolls—among others the entire works of
Berosus and Manetho and Sanconiathon, of which, unfortunately,
we now have only a few fragments.</p>

<p>At length they stopped before a small open office,
within which sat a uniformed official. He rose respectfully.
Seti asked for the University register.</p>

<p>“Write your name, as you wish it to be known, here,”
he said, pointing to a page, “and then pay to this man
as initiation fee one gold <i>stater</i>. Then when I have written<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[98]</a></span>
my name as sponsor over against yours on the opposite
page, you will be a member of the University and entitled
to wear its badge conspicuously on your tunic—also, whenever
you please, the University toga. But this latter is
usually reserved for special occasions, and can be procured
at your leisure.”</p>

<p>Aleph followed directions and received a large gold
badge, which he was told was only one <i>stater</i> additional.
Seti himself fastened it conspicuously on the tunic of the
new student. He also received from the registrar a syllabus
of the lectures for many weeks at both the Serapeum
and Museum. Glancing it over he noticed that Seti was
one of the lecturers and Philo another—the one on history
and ethical philosophy, the other on Plato and comparative
religions.</p>

<p>“Now,” said Seti, as they were returning through the
lecture room, “I have hurried you through these formalities
for two reasons—one of which is that I wish you to
have as soon as possible the benefit of being a recognized
member of our University. The other reason is that I
wish to get you to do me a favor. Just before you came
I had a message from Rachel, my granddaughter, that
the Greek leech, who is employed for her nurse, has gone
back to his old treatment and that the woman is again
rapidly sinking. It seems that the husband not merely
supports the leech in his course, but absolutely requires it
of him. I suspect that the brute wants to get rid of her.
Now, I have an important engagement this morning,
which will prevent my going personally to look after the
case at the time she mentions—I see by this clepsydra
that the time is near—and as the matter is urgent I could
wish to have you go in my stead and deal with both the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[99]</a></span>
husband and the leech as you may find occasion in order
to save the woman’s life. Can you do me this favor? I
think there is no lecture to-day.”</p>

<p>“Certainly,” said Aleph, “I will do what I can, for
your treatment is that of my own country; though, I confess,
I do not at present see how I am to enforce your
wishes in case the leech and the husband should both
prove obstinate.”</p>

<p>“That is a difficulty,” returned the Egyptian; “but
I must leave you to solve it as you best can. This will be
no disadvantage to your education. The young man who
has learned how to deal with difficult men in difficult circumstances
has graduated at a higher university than
teaches in the Serapeum and Museum. So take a lesson
in the university of human nature; and, perhaps, when I
join you, which will be as soon as my business will allow,
you can reproduce the lesson for me.”</p>

<p>Aleph could not well help noticing the change that
had come over the manners of the porter as Seti and himself
approached the postern in close conversation. The
man had exchanged impudence for obsequiousness. He
was all deference and humbleness. His bow was so low,
as he set the postern wide open, that one might reasonably
have feared that the hinge in his back had entirely
given way in favor of a prostration. Has it not been
noticed in all ages that impudence and servility are near
of kin to each other and are never far apart?</p>

<p>In due time Aleph presented himself at the house of
the sick woman. The same forbidding looking man who
had acted as porter before now answered to his knock, but
only opened the door a hand breadth.</p>

<p>After waiting a moment for an invitation to enter,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[100]</a></span>
which he did not get, the young man said, “Will you not
permit me to enter?”</p>

<p>“What is your business?” demanded the fellow in a
surly tone, making the opening of the door still less.</p>

<p>“A friendly one,” said Aleph. “I will explain it
more fully when I have entered and delivered to you—that
is, if you are the husband of the sick woman—some
money which I have for you.”</p>

<p>The word money seemed to throw a shade of uncertainty
into the man’s face. At length he said: “I am
her husband. Why cannot you deliver the money to me
here?”</p>

<p>“Of course I can,” said Aleph. “The only difficulty
lies in my disposition. The gold is in my pouch, my arm
is long enough to reach it, and your hand is near enough
to take it: but you see, man, it does not suit my humor
to give gold to a man who is rude enough to shut his door
in my face. I hardly think you yourself would be liberal
under like circumstances—would you?”</p>

<p>“My wife is very sick—it may be dying. Your coming
in will disturb her.”</p>

<p>“Dying people are not apt to be disturbed by a step
and voice as light as mine will be. Besides, if the woman
is dying you will need the gold all the more. Death and
burial in Alexandria must be expensive. I suppose there
are some people here who cannot afford to die.”</p>

<p>“Well,” said the man, slowly and after a pause, “you
can come in; but I cannot let you remain but a few moments.”</p>

<p>Aleph promptly stepped in as the door opened; and,
while the man was closing and fastening it, made his way
to the room he had before visited. As before, the air was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[101]</a></span>
close and almost stifling. As before, the woman lay on
the bed, in about the same death-like state. And, as before,
Rachel sat behind her, supporting her head and caressing
it with her hand—her own face a picture of lovely
distress. A man at a table was, apparently, preparing
some medicines. He was not a bad looking man, save as
a certain pretentious and stubborn look is a bad one on a
face somewhat stony and unsympathetic. One would say
that his sympathy with his patients would not be likely to
interfere with his health or his meals. His whole bearing
seemed to say, “I am a leech, and I understand my business;”
and yet his dress was too poor to suggest the idea
of a prosperous business. All this the observant eye of
the young man took in at a glance.</p>

<p>Rachel looked up. A look of glad recognition sprang
into every feature, but especially into her welcoming eyes.
They smiled on him through tears. He bowed profoundly
in acknowledgment of the silent greeting; and, advancing
to her, said in a low voice, “From your grandfather.”
Facing about on the husband, who had closely followed
him, he put a piece of gold in his hand, saying as
he did so, “For the sick woman.”</p>

<p>Then turning to the leech, he said in a courteous tone:</p>

<p>“I think I am speaking to the physician in charge of
this patient. If so, will he allow me a few words, with
him in private? Perhaps we can step out into this little
court for a few moments”—and he at once quietly moved
to the door leading to the back court, opened it, and passed
out without looking behind him—passed to the farther
side of the inclosure, as if sure of being followed. He <em>was</em>
followed, though with some backwardness.</p>

<p>“I wish,” said Aleph, as he turned and confronted the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[102]</a></span>
leech, “to confer with you about this poor woman. I
come from some of her friends. Perhaps you know who
these friends are?”</p>

<p>“Is not her husband a friend?”</p>

<p>“He certainly ought to be. As to whether he is, I
have my doubts. At all events he is not one of the friends
of whom I speak and from whom I come. Do you know
who that young lady yonder is?”</p>

<p>“The daughter of Alexander, the great Jewish
Banker.”</p>

<p>“Do you know who Seti is?”</p>

<p>“He is the Egyptian high-priest and primate.”</p>

<p>“Well, these are the friends in whose behalf I have
come and for whom I speak. They wish to save this
woman, and believe it can be done by the treatment which
was so successful for the short time it was tried. Will
you tell me why it was discontinued?”</p>

<p>“Because it was contrary to all the medical rules; but
mainly because the man who employs me insisted on a return
to the old treatment.”</p>

<p>“You mean the husband of the sick woman?”</p>

<p>“Yes.”</p>

<p>“Are you sure that your employer is able and disposed
to pay you for your services?”</p>

<p>“He evidently is poor; but he says that he has rich
friends who can be depended on for all expenses. This
seems to be true; for the house has been lavishly supplied
for the last few days with every possible comfort by
some friends.”</p>

<p>“Whom do you suppose these friends to be?”</p>

<p>“The family of Alexander the Alabarch.”</p>

<p>“Certainly these are friends worth having,” said Aleph<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[103]</a></span>
with emphasis; “and no doubt they can be depended on
to meet all expenses—if they will promise as much. And
this they are ready to do, and more, provided you will
meet their wishes in certain respects.”</p>

<p>“What do they wish?” said the leech after quite a
pause.</p>

<p>“That you will take them for employer instead of this
vagabond; accept such compensation for your professional
services as they are accustomed to pay; and then, in the
interest of science, suspend for a little your way of treating
this case in favor of the one you have just abandoned.
We will assume all responsibilities. If the experiment
does not work well, you can return to the old treatment.
You had better have the patronage of the Alabarch and
the Egyptian primate than that of this scoundrel—for
such he is, unless his looks greatly belie him.”</p>

<p>“I have no very high opinion of him, I confess,” said
the leech. “I have seen more tender husbands than he;
and the woman’s talk about him in her delirium is far
from complimentary. But if we change the treatment he
will be troublesome. He was very violent when he discovered
the first change.”</p>

<p>“Did he tell you by whose authority it was made?”</p>

<p>“He only said that a strange man had been meddling
with what did not concern him.”</p>

<p>“Then he did not tell you that this meddler was Seti?”</p>

<p>“Certainly not.”</p>

<p>“Nor did the nurse?”</p>

<p>“No—but she is mortally afraid of the man, and that
may have kept her silent.”</p>

<p>“Nor did the young lady?”</p>

<p>“No: but she had some difficulty in getting admission<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[104]</a></span>
to the house, as I think you had; and it is possible that
the man would not admit her till she had promised not to
interfere, and had sent away her servants. Indeed, I
thought I overheard as much.”</p>

<p>“No doubt the fellow will be troublesome. The only
thing to be done is to keep such a force here as will be
able to control him. As long as we are here we can do
this; but when we leave we must leave behind others who
will make our places good. I think I can arrange for
this.... Now that we have come to an understanding,
let us go in; but do you take the lead, as is fitting, in
making the changes.”</p>

<p>When they re-entered the room they found the man
standing where they had left him—with anything but
amiability in his face.</p>

<p>“We have agreed,” said the leech to him, “in order
to satisfy important friends, to try for a while a change
in the treatment. Sometimes the failing powers will rally
wonderfully under a complete change of conditions. At
any rate we will try it.”</p>

<p>He at once set wide open door and casement. Then
going to the water-jug, he poured out a large cup full of
water and brought it to Aleph, who had kneeled at the
bedside and was listening again at the parched and twitching
lips of the unconscious woman. He let a few drops
fall upon them. He gently tried to part the locked teeth,
and dropped more. At last he put the cup to her mouth.</p>

<p>“STOP!” shouted the husband, as he rushed up—his
face white with passion and a demon looking out of his
eyes—and with his clenched hand struck the cup aside,
spilling a large part of the water on the woman’s face—“<span class="smcap">Stop!</span>
I say: this woman is under my protection.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[105]</a></span></p>

<p>In a moment, Aleph was erect and confronting him:</p>

<p>“And <em>such</em> a protection!” he scornfully said. “Such
a protection as the thunder cloud gives to the tree it
strikes—such a protection as you have been giving her,
ever since you enticed her away from her friends under
the pretense that you were a man and not a brute. To
my eyes the very shadow that you cast, and a very black
shadow it is, is that of a wild beast of the meaner kind.
I have not listened at these white lips in vain. I know
something of your story, and expect to know more
shortly—know enough now to say that this woman wishes
no such protector. Death would be a better one. After
having made her life miserable you shall not go on to put
her to death—as you seem to wish. Now, do you understand
that we shall proceed to treat this woman as the
leech has said, and if you interfere, or make any disturbance
whatever unsuitable to a sick-room, we will find such
ways of quieting you as may be necessary—for quiet we
will have, even if we have to turn you over to the police
as a dangerous character.”</p>

<p>Aleph said this, not loudly, but in so determined and
commanding a manner, and with such rebuking and
threatening eyes fastened on the hateful face before him,
that for a moment that face took on a shade of fear and
shame among its other shades—of which it had not a few.
But it was only for a moment. He reinforced himself, as
such fellows are apt to do, by a mighty oath and seemed
about to spring on the young man; but noting again his
watchful eye, the cane in his hand, and his whole attitude
so full of lithe and conscious power, he thought better of
it, and fell back on the fighting resources of his tongue.</p>

<p>“This is my wife, and this is my house, at least for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[106]</a></span>
the time being; and I will do with them as I please. Because
you are an aristocrat, and belong to the university,
and wear better clothes than I, you think you can treat
me like a dog. But a dog can bite, especially one of my
breed; and if I had as many heads as Cerberus they should
all have a bite at you. So help me all the infernals!”</p>

<p>He flung out of the room. They heard him fiercely
unfastening the street door and then fiercely slamming it
behind him as he rushed into the street.</p>

<p>Aleph at once followed him and secured the door.
Returning, he resumed his work at the bed as if nothing
had happened—no more color in his cheek, no more excitement
in his eye, no less steadiness in his hand as he
again held a cup of water to the woman’s lips. Her eyes
were now open and fastened on him. Perhaps the water
with which her face had been flooded had freshened her
back to consciousness. Perhaps, too, the stormy scene
that had just passed did something toward summoning
back her retreating vitality. While she drank, cup after
cup, as if it were the nectar of the immortals, she never
took her eyes, eyes that seemed full of wonder, from the
calm, compassionate, restful young face that bent over
her. She afterward said that it seemed to her the face of
some benevolent and protecting divinity.</p>

<p>Her skin grew moist. Great beads of sweat came out
on her forehead. By degrees her eyelids drew together
and she slept—slept as sleeps the infant, or as sleeps some
still landscape after the drenching shower has passed.</p>

<p>“What food did she ask for yesterday?” said the
leech to the nurse, who had just come in from another
room. “Make ready the same for her against she
awakes.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[107]</a></span></p>

<p>“And the lady Rachel,” said Aleph, “will excuse me
for suggesting that she ought now to relieve herself from
her burden. The woman will do quite as well if laid
quietly down.”</p>

<p>So Rachel softly disengaged herself, and gently placed
the thin, worn, but now placid cheek on the pillow. She
then went to the casement and stood there a moment reflectively.
Then, turning to Aleph, she said:</p>

<p>“I think I will step out into the open air, and perhaps
you will be kind enough to follow me.”</p>

<p>Of course he followed her. Such a vision of loveliness
and grace as glided past him into the court is not apt to
summon even a philosopher in vain. I am not sure but
that he would have followed her to Britain had she asked
him, instead of to that rude bench in the farther part of
the court where she seated herself and invited him to do
the same.</p>

<p>She said that he must not wonder that she wanted to
thank him for standing between her and insult yesterday
at the synagogue—also must not wonder that she had a
woman’s curiosity to know by what means he had managed
to gain admittance to the house, and then to carry
his point so fully with the leech. Would he explain?
So he gave a modest account of his dealings with both the
husband and the leech; and then smilingly demanded
reciprocation. The lady must not wonder that he too had
some curiosity to know something of her experience with
the same rough customers. He found that, as the leech
had surmised, she could not get admittance to the house
till she had sent back her servants and had promised not
to interfere personally with the treatment. She was very
reluctant to do both things; but she felt that she could<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[108]</a></span>
not desert her nurse at such a time. Besides, she was
expecting Seti, and encouraged herself with the hope of
his speedy arrival. However, she was almost afraid to
come within doors—the man was so rude and surly. And
she did not fail to tell what a weight was lifted from her
mind as soon as Aleph made his appearance.</p>

<p>But what did he propose? Would not Miriam’s husband
come back and break up all that had been done?
And such a desperado! What threats! She trembled to
think what he might do. Must not Aleph be on his
guard? How sorry she was that his unselfish efforts
for others should bring him into such perils! Her lips
quivered, and she looked at him with moist, anxious
eyes.</p>

<p>Aleph acknowledged that he thought the fellow capable
of the worst. He <em>would</em> be on his guard. At the
same time he did not think that they need fear his return.
If he should come back he must find men in the house
able to control him. So the leech and himself would
remain till the coming of Seti; who perhaps would accompany
her home and return with two strong and resolute
men to take their places. So by alternation they
must secure the patient till she could be taken elsewhere—which
he thought would be very soon. What did the
lady think of the plan?</p>

<p>She thought favorably of it; and had no doubt but
that her father would do the same. But what trouble
and danger Aleph was taking on himself in all this!</p>

<p>“Do I look as if troubled by it?” said the young man
cheerfully. “You see, I am here partly for educational
purposes; and I consider the opportunities which may
daily come to me for dealing wisely and helpfully with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[109]</a></span>
men as so many valuable teachers; and, as to personal
danger, I am quite willing to pay that price for my tuition.
But pardon me, lady, when I say that you who
leave your palace for such a place as this, and submit to
bad air, and rude treatment, and risk of health for the
sake of a very humble person who can never repay you,
ought not to be surprised at my conduct. I am comparatively
selfish in my conduct. In purity of motive, I
fear that you have greatly the advantage of me. Still I
hope that you will not on that account refuse my interested
help in your disinterested work. By and by,
when my education is finished, I hope my motives will be
as unselfish as your own.” He smiled as he added, “But
I should be sorry to have you think that I am, even now,
quite without pity for suffering, and indignation at injustice
and wrong.”</p>

<p>After a moment’s pause, during which his face resumed
the serene gravity of expression which was habitual
to it, he went on:</p>

<p>“But, lady, besides wanting to complete my education,
I have another want in regard to which you may
perhaps help me, and so amply compensate me on commercial
principles for all I have done or may do for your
friend. I am very much interested to get accurate information
from Judea about Jesus. Any news that may
reach you about that remarkable person will be to me like
waters to a desert. Your father’s position is such that
information will naturally come to him and to you.”</p>

<p>“I am not sure of that,” returned Rachel. “We get,
it is true, a plenty of rumors and opinions about Jesus;
but they come to us, I fear, shaped and colored by the
strong prejudices and seeming interests of the chief people<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[110]</a></span>
of our nation, who are mostly hostile to him. These
are about the only ones with whom my father is in communication.
But now and then we meet with a man,
like Simeon, who heartily wishes to know the truth, whatever
that may be.”</p>

<p>“Such was the impression he made on me,” said
Aleph.</p>

<p>“Speaking of him,” said the maiden, “reminds me
of a piece of news which he brought us this morning, and
which my anxiety about Miriam had almost driven from
my mind. He said that he had just heard from a friend
whom he had engaged to make certain inquiries for him
that in the birth-registers of Bethlehem is recorded the
birth, some thirty years ago, of one Jesus, the son of
Joseph and Mary, both of whom are said to be descended
from David. He also said that the same friend reported
some additional particulars in regard to the reformer
John, who made so great a stir a short time before Jesus
became generally known, and whom many for a time took
to be the Christ.”</p>

<p>“Pray tell me of him,” said the young man, with a
kindling face, “for I have heard absolutely nothing. And
yet the Sacred Books say that the Messiah must have a
forerunner like Elijah in character, if not in name. I
have had a difficulty here.”</p>

<p>“Perhaps, then, what I have to tell may help you as
it has helped me. Simeon learns that this man, who for
a time filled the eye of the whole people and was then put
to death by that Ahab whom we call Herod, was exceedingly
like Elijah in austerity of life and fearless denunciation
of sin, and that he distinctly forbade the people to
count him more than the forerunner of the Christ, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[111]</a></span>
even introduced Jesus to the people as being the Christ
they were expecting. And this agrees with the reports
that reached Alexandria at the time.”</p>

<p>“Many thanks for this information; it adds another
link to the chain of evidence I am seeking.”</p>

<p>“So it has been with me,” said the maiden, while a
shade of deeper thoughtfulness, if not of sadness, came
over the bewildering beauty of her face as she added,
“and I begin to fear that our chain when followed to the
end will conduct us to some new and very unpopular
interpretations of the prophets.”</p>

<p>“I have for some time been prepared for that,” said
the young man, calmly and even cheerfully. “The great
thing is to get at the truth: and I whom you have suffered
to read your face as we have talked together need
no further assurance that we think alike in this matter.
We are both young; and youth can accommodate itself
more easily than age to new views if they must come.
May Aleph, the Chaldean stranger, venture so largely as
to hope that in his search for the Messiah he may still
have the aid of one whom he knows to be the first lady in
the land in position, and whom her grandfather, who
ought to know, and whom I am far from being disposed
to contradict, pronounces the Gem of Alexandria?”</p>

<p>“You do well to smile,” said the maiden, blushing.
“My grandfather is very poor authority on such matters.
I happen to know that Alexandrian gems are of very poor
quality and mostly fictitious. But, seriously, whatever a
Jewish maiden can properly do to help in your matter she
will gladly do, both for her own sake, and for his sake
who has been in this city, perhaps three days, and has as
many times befriended me and mine.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[112]</a></span></p>

<p>Here a loud knock was heard at the street-door. They
at once returned to the sick-room—and Aleph went on to
answer the knock, hoping to find Seti. And Seti it proved
to be. Before conducting him to the others, Aleph briefly
and in a low voice explained the situation and received
the full approval of the Egyptian. On entering the sick-room
they found the patient awake with intelligence in
her eye, and her arm about the neck of Rachel, who had
kneeled at the bedside. The nurse was standing at a little
distance with a bowl of food.</p>

<p>“I am afraid of Antis,” they heard murmured as they
came near.</p>

<p>“You mean your husband?” inquired Rachel.</p>

<p>“Yes,” feebly articulated the woman; “he is a fearful
man—a murderer. Do not leave me with him”—and
her arms clung still more closely about the fair neck as if
for protection.</p>

<p>“He shall not trouble you more,” said Seti emphatically,
as he showed himself. “But now take some food,”—and
he beckoned the nurse forward.</p>

<p>Supported by Rachel from behind, Miriam supped
from a spoon at intervals with apparent relish, till at
length her eyelids again crept slowly together and she
was gently laid back to her unfinished slumbers.</p>

<p>“She will do well, but must not relapse again,” said
Seti: and turning to the leech, “Keep on as you have
begun—we will take the responsibility. I confirm all
that this young man has promised. He will, I understand,
remain with you till I can accompany the lady
home, and come back with some men to relieve him and
you. Of course, after what the sick woman has said of
her husband, we are justified in excluding him from the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[113]</a></span>
house. Do not allow him to enter under any pretense.
If he insists, threaten him with the police.”</p>

<p>As Aleph put up the bars of the street-door behind
Rachel and her escort, he felt as if he were barring out a
sunbeam. There is nothing like a human face of the
diviner type to light up a poor and dark house. Aleph
did not realize how poor and dark that sick house was in
itself till Rachel had left it and he had again placed himself
at the bedside. Here he sat for quite a time lost in
thought till, suddenly, he became aware that Miriam was
awake and with wide eyes of placid wonder was gazing at
him. At a sign from him the nurse came forward with
more food and drink, supported her while he gently put
to her lips at intervals a little of both, and then gently
laid her down, her drooping eyes still seeking his face, to
renewed slumber. This occurred again before Seti appeared
with three strong and resolute looking men—who
being old servants of Alexander and well known to Miriam
in former days, were thought most likely to give her a
sense of security by their presence.</p>

<p>Seti and Aleph returned to Rachotis together.</p>

<p>They had scarcely turned away from the house before
Antis came out from a recess across the street and stole
after them—at a distance, but so as to keep them in sight.
And they were not without particular notice from others.
Two such commanding figures as to stature and bearing
were not a common sight in Alexandria; and so the men
whom they met would sometimes turn and gaze after
them. One of these did more than stop and gaze. He
followed—followed on one side of the street as Antis was
following on the other.</p>

<p>I wonder what he meant! Was he a friend or an<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[114]</a></span>
enemy? Or was it merely idleness and curiosity that
prompted the following?</p>

<p>These latter make a motor of considerable power;
sometimes even of fully as much power as any of our celebrated
modern motors, or those mysterious ones used in
the construction of the pyramids. And it certainly was
in daily use in Egypt among all classes at the time of our
narrative, and long before. Before the Ptolemies, before
the Pharaohs, before the Dispersion, before Tubal Cain—in
fact there is some reason to think that this motor was
invented by the first man (some say by the first woman;
but this is a base slander), and was from him handed down
to all ages and countries. How else can we account for
its omnipresence!</p>

<p>So it is by no means incredible that the following of
Aleph just spoken of was not due to hostility. I hope it
was not. I hope it did not mean mischief. Still I confess
to some fears. Somehow I begin to feel an interest
in that young man; and if any harm should come to him
it would trouble me not a little.</p>

<h3>VI.<br />
<span class="smaller">THE CUSTOM HOUSE.</span></h3>

<p>Aleph found Cimon already at the khan; and, after
giving an account of his own experiences, received
the following from his friend.</p>

<p>Cimon went first to the khan they had just left for an
article that had been forgotten, and to learn what he
might of the ways of the neighboring custom house.</p>

<p>He found that he was yet considerably too early for
the business hours of the chief official; and so lingered,
making inquiries of the inn-keeper about the chief traders
of the city, especially in the line of eastern goods.
Who are they? Where are their places of business?
How long have they been established? What reputations
do they bear? These questions were freely answered—with
some vagueness and reserve, however, as to the last
of them; as was to be expected from a man who speaks
about his neighbors to a stranger. Cimon found that
Malus was by far the largest and most successful dealer
in the city.</p>

<p>“How did that happen?”</p>

<p>“Well, you see, he has the most capital: so he has
the best goods, the cheapest, and the greatest variety;
and then his positions as harbor-master and farmer-general
of all imports from the south give him special advantages<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[118]</a></span>
for turning trade in his own direction. As
harbor-master he is the first one to meet the owners of
goods on their arrival, and can hasten or delay the passing
through the custom house: as farmer of the duties
he has less duty to pay than his rivals, even if he makes
none of the illegal exactions with which some charge
him. However this may be, it is certain that he has
very great opportunities of befriending those who deal
with him, and <em>can</em> make it for their interest to patronize
him rather than others. People lay much stress on this.
So he has crushed out many small dealers. Still, not a
few manage to maintain themselves against him, though
they make small profits where he makes large ones.
There are yet many people who for various reasons prefer
to go elsewhere than to Nos. 110, 111, 112 Emporium
Street. We are among them”—and the man shrugged
his shoulders.</p>

<p>Cimon took out his tablets and made some entries.</p>

<p>While he was doing this, who should come in but the
Jew who had so curiously followed him from the synagogue!
The man was surprised, and apparently delighted,
to see Cimon. It appeared that he was a brother
of the absent landlord, and had come to bring news of
him to his family. He had left him in Judea a few days
before, and expected that he would soon be able to return.
He then turned to Cimon and inquired about his
young companion of yesterday.</p>

<p>“That young man haunts me,” he said. “His face
meets me everywhere; if I read, his features come between
me and the papyrus; if some one enters my house
I look up to see if it is not he; if I am walking in the
street I forget my errand and look for him instead. For<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[119]</a></span>
example, while on my way here I forgot what I was
coming for, and found myself opposite the Diapleuston
waiting for him to appear, and, had he appeared, no
doubt I should have acted as ridiculously as I did yesterday.”</p>

<p>Cimon explained that they had seen occasion to remove
to another part of the city; but were still proposing
to seek him out and hear about the eastern pilgrims of
whom he had spoken. Perhaps he would not object to
give some particulars now—reserving to some future
time, when his young friend could be with him, a fuller
account. Could they not pass into the court and seat
themselves where they would not be exposed to interruption?</p>

<p>The Jew readily consented: and this was the substance
of his narrative.</p>

<p>When he was scarcely more than a boy there came to
the khan on the east of the city, then kept by his father,
a large caravan of eastern people, on their way home
from Judea. It was led by three men—all remarkable
for dignity of manner, richness of apparel, and other
signs of great distinction, if not of princely rank. Two
of them were old men; but old after the manner of
Moses. Their eyes were as bright, their forms as erect,
their steps as firm and elastic as one ever sees in the
young. But the third was comparatively young: and a
finer specimen of humanity in all respects the khan had
never seen, though it had seen, first and last, a wide
variety of people from all nations.</p>

<p>Ah, that young man knew how to walk—how to
ride too! When he came and went, whether on foot or
on his Arabian, the servants would run to every convenient<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[120]</a></span>
outlook to wonder at the easy grace and majesty of
his movements.</p>

<p>On the arrival of the caravan the khan happened
to be quite without guests. The pilgrims at once took
all the vacant rooms, and remained several days in the
city—examining it fully in every direction; its temples,
palaces, harbors, markets, warehouses, manufactures, libraries,
schools. They evidently were very devout persons;
not as the idolaters are, but after the Hebrew manner.
Every morning and evening they gathered all their
servants, and read from copies of the Law and Prophets,
and prayed most reverently to the Invisible; and on the
Sabbath they went separately to the synagogues; and
when they left the city they carried away with them
many copies of the Greek Scriptures—also, it was said, a
Greek young man, well taught in all the western learning
and accomplishments, but who had lost his parents
and other near relatives, and so had few ties to detain
him here. This was what was <em>said</em>: the Jew could not
vouch for it, as he had never seen the young Greek.</p>

<p>But these were not the most important facts about
the pilgrims. Some in the caravan spoke the Greek language
and the people of the inn used to listen with wonder
to the story that gradually came to them.</p>

<p>For generations it had been widely understood in
parts of the East that a great king would some day appear
in Judea in whom all the families of the earth
would be blessed. But lately it was revealed to each of
the three chiefs that the birth of this king was about to
take place, and that when it had taken place the fact
would be signified to them by the appearance of a new
star-like body in the western sky, and that on seeing it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[121]</a></span>
they should journey westward to carry the homage and
presents of the East to the new-born monarch. So they
conferred together, made ready their caravans, and
watched the heavens nightly for the promised sign.</p>

<p>At last it came. The day had faded away into the
night, when lo, a glorious beam shot to the watchers,
and they saw a great star hanging low in the west—a star
wholly unlike the evening star, or any other star ever
seen in that quarter of the sky. The signal was
promptly and joyfully obeyed. Meeting at a place before
agreed upon, the chiefs joined caravans and proceeded
toward Judea—the star appearing and going before
them whenever their journey needed special guidance.
So at last they came to Bethlehem, where the
meteor sank low and blazed over the house where a young
child was. Then they knew that they had found the
King; though it was in no palace, but in a very humble
home bare of all but the barest necessaries.</p>

<p>Was it a beautiful child? Even as Moses, exceeding
fair. Was he afraid of the bearded men as they kneeled
before him and presented their gold and frankincense
and myrrh? Not at all. There were the dawnings of a
kingly repose and welcome in his eyes as he fearlessly
stretched out his little hand and laid it on the thin white
hairs and on the dense brown locks that were successively
bowed low before him.</p>

<p>And then they heard of things even stranger than
those they had themselves experienced. For the mother
told them of angels who came to predict the Messiah
and his forerunner: and many people of Bethlehem, attracted
by the star and the stately caravan, came hastening
up and told how their shepherds had seen and heard<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[122]</a></span>
on the night of the Birth a glory of angels that shone and
sang above them like a descending heaven, and sent them
to a manger to find their long expected King.</p>

<p>The youngest of the three chiefs was so much impressed
by the story of the shepherds that he put it into
a song which some in the caravan learned and often
chanted.</p>

<p>“Did you hear it?” interrupted Cimon.</p>

<p>“Yes: and our father would have us commit it to
memory. I think that even now I can recite it word for
word.”</p>

<p>“Please do so.”</p>

<p>The Jew, after a few moments of recollection, proceeded
to recite as follows:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">

<p>There were tremblings on the tongue of the Jew as
he closed his low chant, and tears in the eyes of the
Greek; but the latter said nothing for a few moments,
and then merely asked that the narrative might proceed.
So the Jew resumed.</p>

<p>The chiefs would willingly have lingered long in
Bethlehem; but the same Divine Word that had brought
them almost immediately sent them away. The next
night the message came, “Let them return—and return
by another way.” So they returned by way of Egypt and
the Red Sea.</p>

<p>Shortly after the pilgrims had left Alexandria, news
came that Herod, in a fit of jealousy, had massacred all
the male children in Bethlehem under two years of age.
It was like him. Everybody believed the story. But
could it be that the Messiah of whose triumphs and reign
so many prophets, in so many ways, had spoken, had
perished in his infancy? Could the promises of God be
broken by the cruelty of man? Was Herod strong
enough to defeat the Almighty?</p>

<p>The khan had hardly begun to ask these questions
before there appeared at its gate a man leading an ass, on
which was seated a young woman who carried in her
arms a little boy. The mother was interesting—the boy
was wonderful. Never had the landlord seen such a
child. It was not merely that he was comely in the
highest degree—it was the mystery of expression in his
face. As one looked on it nothing seemed too good or
great to be believed of him. His body seemed a thin veil
through which flashes of inexhaustible treasures of wisdom
and goodness and power were continually struggling.
You who have seen a light shining through thin<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[125]</a></span>
alabaster—you who have seen a gem in whose heart rainbows
seemed imprisoned—you who have seen a soft,
white cloud around whose edges have crept suggestions
of an intolerable glory within and behind, can have some
idea of how that wonderful Child impressed the people of
the khan. By degrees they learned that the family had
come from Bethlehem, that fear of Herod was the cause
of their leaving, that the eastern princes had been under
their roof—at last, when confidence was full-grown and
all reserve thrown away, that they had among them the
very Star-Child to which the journeying East had
brought its loyal homage and tribute.</p>

<p>It was strange to see the mixture of tenderness and
awe with which the mother dealt with her son—strange
to see the mixture of weakness and power, of humbleness
and superiority, of dependence and independence with
which the son dealt with his mother. At one moment it
seemed as if she was acting the part of a Providence to
him; at another as if he was acting the part of a Providence
to her.</p>

<p>The house was a different house from the time that
Jesus (for such was his name) entered it. A new element
had come into its air; a new light seemed to rest
on every object; never had its inmates found it so easy
to pray and lead a good life. It was as if a new life had
silently come under their own; and, like a broad wave,
was lifting it heavenward. The eyes of Jesus, from their
fathomless depths, seemed to invite to all that was holy
and to forbid all that was sinful.</p>

<p>But even Alexandria was too near Herod. So, after
the sacred family had well rested from their journey,
they went still farther south. It was a sad day for the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[126]</a></span>
khan when they went away. The host would take nothing
in the way of compensation—save a smile from the
young mother and a touch from the child for each child
of his. How that touch thrilled them through and
through as with some mysterious healing! They think
they can feel it to-day.</p>

<p>The khan kept its secret. After a while news
came that the Holy Family went as far as Mantaréëh,
and remained there till the death of Herod, when they
returned to their own country. After that, ears were
kept wide-open toward Judea; for it could not be
thought that such a beginning would end in nothing—that
man and circumstance would be allowed to defeat
God.</p>

<p>But the waiting was long. Ten years passed,
twenty years, almost thirty, and yet no further news
came of Jesus. The khan was sorely puzzled. It knew
not what to think. Yet it still clung to faith and hope.
At last it began to hear vaguely of strange excitements
and movements in Judea. The eyes and ears of the
whole family turned in that direction as never before.
And soon they learned that a great reformer had burst
suddenly on the people from the wilderness—austere,
fearless, mighty of speech, smiting the sins of high and
low with the sword of his mouth, baptizing, followed by
immense crowds, who inquired, Is not this the Christ?</p>

<p>And this, too, was the question that was asked at
the gate of Canopus. But they reflected that, according
to the prophets, Christ must have a forerunner of just
this Elijah-like character; and so they were prepared to
hear, as they soon did, that the reformer’s name was
John the son of Zacharias, and that he distinctly told<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[127]</a></span>
the people that he was not the Christ, only his forerunner.
Then came rumors of Another; at first low-voiced
and vague, then more distinct and emphatic—that John
had introduced him to the people as the Greater One for
whom he had been preparing the way; then that John
himself had been slain by Herod; then that the new
prophet whose name was Jesus was drawing the multitudes
after him by a sublime teaching and a course of
miracles such as had not been seen since the days of
Moses, if ever. Of course the Alexandrian friends then
felt sure that they had recovered the long lost Child.
The king of whom they had heard from the Chaldean
sages, whose star had conducted that most memorable of
all pilgrimages, and whose sublime childhood they had
been permitted to look in upon, as by a window into
heaven, was now being manifested to the nation at large.
And though he had not come in the way the nation at
large was expecting—was appearing as a king of wisdom
and mercies, instead of as a king of battles and conquests—they
felt sure that at last the Messiah had come to his
own; and that, beyond all doubt, Jesus was he. In the
joy of this great conviction the father died.</p>

<p>Such, in substance, though not in words, was the narrative
of the Jew. As he proceeded in it he gradually
came to speak with profound emotion. He ended with a
voice that trembled and eyes that wept. Cimon was
hardly less moved. They sat for a few moments in silence.
Then Cimon said:</p>

<p>“This has been the fairest of mornings to me.
Though a Greek by birth, I am a Hebrew in faith and
expectations; and never did David so long for the waters
of Bethlehem as I have longed for news of that Son of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[128]</a></span>
David and of Bethlehem, your Messiah. I say <em>your</em> Messiah;
but I have reason to think that he is mine also;
even to think that he belongs to all nations. Sometimes,
perhaps, when my young friend is with me I will explain
further. But I may now say that, from what you have
just told me, and from what I knew before, I am satisfied
that the Christ has at last come and that Jesus is he.
God be praised! Some difficulties still remain, and perhaps
will always remain. Hard questions, questions that
I cannot answer, stare at me out of the night. And yet,
God be praised! The King has at last come.”</p>

<p>The Jew grasped the hand of the Greek and murmured
<i>Brother</i>.</p>

<p>“Let me tell you another thing,” the Jew added,
after a moment. “I have <em>seen</em> him. Yes, I have seen
Jesus and recognized in the full-grown man the unutterable
something that spoke so powerfully to us in the
child.”</p>

<p>“When and where?” demanded the other.</p>

<p>“Not in dreams, though I scarcely dream of anything
else, but with these bodily eyes. You see that, as news
of the wonderful doings in Judea thickened upon us, I
became too restless to remain quietly here while the
world was being shaken only a few days’ journey away.
My brother, who long before the death of our father had
taken this khan, felt very much as I did; and so we
agreed to go together and see for ourselves, instead of
having the facts filtered to us through the imaginations
and prejudices, it may be, of other people. Accordingly
we went; and not only recognized him, as I have said,
but were at once recognized by him and called by our
names. None of our acquaintances were about him, we<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[129]</a></span>
knew not a soul in Capernaum, and yet, as soon as he
saw us, he said ‘Shaphan and Nathan, sons of Reuben,
welcome.’.... We were with him several days and
heard him teach the people as surely people were never
before taught. <em>We</em> said, as did his other hearers, <i>Never
man spake like this man</i>. And then the things that he
did! Oh, it was good and yet awful to be there! How
mightily and easily he did things which God alone can
do! We saw lepers white as snow turned into sound
men at his simple word: also one man who had lost a
hand had it instantaneously restored in our presence. In
passing through the country we met many who testified
that they had been cured by him of the worst forms of
disease in their last stages—cured in a moment, and
without the use of any natural means whatever. Indeed,
the land is full of such cases, so that not even the worst
enemies of Jesus pretend to doubt his miraculous
powers.”</p>

<p>“Tell me of the man whose hand was restored,” said
Cimon.</p>

<p>“A company of us were passing through a street when
some blind men met us and cried to Jesus for help. We
halted just before a butcher’s stall where a man was dividing
some meat with a cleaver. Another man and myself
were pressed by the crowd close to the block where
the work was being done. In his anxiety to see Jesus
deal with the blind men, my neighbor laid his hand on
the block suddenly, for the purpose of raising himself
somewhat to get a better view, when the cleaver descended
and struck off his entire hand. The blood
spouted. A great outcry was made, and Jesus came up.
He calmly said to the maimed man as he held up the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[130]</a></span>
bleeding stump, <i>Be whole</i>: and at once I saw a new hand
occupying the place of the old. The whole crowd, as
well as myself, carefully inspected the substitute and
compared it with the original hand that still lay on the
block.”</p>

<p>“Missing limbs are not suddenly reproduced by
human art,” said Cimon.</p>

<p>“I am tempted to mention another matter more personal
to myself,” continued Shaphan. “I have already
said that Jesus called us by our names. We found the
next day that he knew more about us than our names.
As my brother and myself were sitting by the wayside,
Jesus came to us and said:</p>

<p>“‘You are troubled. When you reach home look
again for the missing document and you will find it.’</p>

<p>“And truly we were in trouble. When we were children
our father was in partnership with a young man.
But this young man gradually drew off into other business,
and at length sold his interest in the khan to my
father, who paid him for it in full and took from him a
paper acknowledging the fact. In process of time this
paper was lost. Of late this loss has somehow come to
the knowledge of the man, and he now claims that he
has never received payment, and demands both the principal
and the interest on it for more than thirty years.
To pay this sum would ruin us. We had been again and
again to our oppressor to ask for mercy. But in vain.
So we <em>were</em> in deep waters when Jesus put out his hand
and drew us out. For since my return I have found the
missing paper.”</p>

<p>“Who is this oppressor?”</p>

<p>“Malus.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[131]</a></span></p>

<p>“Has he already begun a suit against you?”</p>

<p>“No: but he threatens to do so within a short time,
unless payment is made.”</p>

<p>“Can it be that he is honest, and has merely forgotten?”</p>

<p>“He does not say that he does not <em>remember</em> having received
the money. He absolutely denies having received
it—could make oath to that effect; has a perfect recollection
of all the circumstances, and has only been prevented
from pressing his claim during all these years by
tenderness of heart.”</p>

<p>“Have you yet told him of the discovery?”</p>

<p>“Not yet.”</p>

<p>“Would you be willing to withhold the news from
him for a while?”</p>

<p>“If you wish.”</p>

<p>“I wish you would: and perhaps we may be of service
in helping you bring this crafty and powerful rogue
to justice. But it will be a hard matter. My fear is
that the officials of the city are themselves in league with
him in some of his practices, and so will be disposed to
shelter him in all.... But this speaking of Malus reminds
me of a matter that I must now attend to.”</p>

<p>Cimon rose. It was time to proceed to the custom
house. So, promising Shaphan to see him again as soon
as possible: also informing him more particularly where
they now lodged, in case he should have occasion to seek
them (“and,” said he, “I hope that your brother will
soon make occasion by bringing further particulars about
Jesus”), he took leave cordially.</p>

<p>The lake frontage was, and had long been, all alive
with business. The cry of all nations was in the air.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[132]</a></span>
In the lake itself vessels of all sorts were coming and going;
on the wharves boxes, bales, sacks were being handled
with the same dispatch and carelessness that men
now show in handling the goods of other people. Also,
the custom house itself (a long, low building extending
almost from the Gate of the Moon to the canal which
joined the lake to the northern harbors) was in full swirl
and roar, and had been for hours. But the chief official,
like people of his sort in more modern times, did not
make as early hours as his subordinates; had loitered
over the morning meal and news, though not newspaper;
and so had only just made himself comfortable in his office
when Cimon presented himself—the first visitor.</p>

<p>The Roman looked up from his tablets on which he
had been writing; and, seeing before him a very well
dressed and dignified person, laid down his stylus and
took an attitude of attention.</p>

<p>Cimon stated that he had waited on the chief of the
customs in behalf of an eminent trader, to make certain
inquiries which could not be so satisfactorily put to lower
officials. Would it suit his convenience to hear them?</p>

<p>“What are they?” said the chief politely.</p>

<p>“If my principal were to send here a lot of eastern
good (silks, shawls, rugs, jewels), what duties would he
have to pay?”</p>

<p>The Roman took down from a shelf a framed schedule
and read from it certain figures. He looked up.
The Greek was making a memorandum.</p>

<p>When he had finished, Cimon asked, “Can these
rates be relied on for some time to come?”</p>

<p>“Doubtless: they have not been changed since the
times of the Ptolemies.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[133]</a></span></p>

<p>Cimon made another entry on his tablets.</p>

<p>“Can you give me some idea what the course of trade
has been in these eastern goods—what its annual amount,
whether subject to fluctuations, whether on the whole
increasing or decreasing?”</p>

<p>“I cannot,” said the official. “To do this would
require much time and labor in examining the registers.”</p>

<p>“Then you register all lots of goods that come to
you, and preserve the registers?”</p>

<p>“Certainly. We preserve them till they become too
many for preservation.”</p>

<p>“May I ask how long that is?”</p>

<p>“About fifteen years. At all events, we have the registry
books for the last fifteen years.”</p>

<p>Cimon made another entry, and then asked whether
one willing to expend the time and labor would be allowed
to examine the books, and if so on what terms.</p>

<p>After some hesitation the official replied that the
theory was that the books should be open to the inspection
of suitable persons, but that there were practical
difficulties in the way.</p>

<p>“For example,” said he, “the books of this year are
in constant use for record and consultation by the officers
of the custom house; the books of previous years are
often needed by them for reference; and then, of course,
an examination of the books by outside parties would
have to be made in the presence of an official, and all the
officials we now have are fully occupied with other duties
from which they cannot well be spared; and one specially
appointed would be expensive, if permissible.”</p>

<p>Cimon said that he was ready to charge himself with
all expenses.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[134]</a></span></p>

<p>The Roman hastened to say that even in that case an
express permit from the prefect of the city, possibly
from the Governor, might be necessary. He would make
inquiry, and, perhaps, would be able to inform him
within a day or two.</p>

<p>The Greek bowed. Meanwhile would the chief look
over the memoranda he had made and see whether they
were correct? He passed over the tablets.</p>

<p>The Roman looked them over carefully and pronounced
them all right.</p>

<p>“Would the chief oblige him by writing as much on
the tablets over his own signature?”</p>

<p>Yes—the chief would do that; and did it.</p>

<p>Cimon bowed again and withdrew.</p>

<p>On his way out he saw Malus entering. The two
men seemed to recognize each other at the same moment.
Instantly there flashed into the look of each something
that told the other that the encounter was not pleasant.
On the part of the Greek the flash was one that gave new
erectness to his form and new gravity to his features: on
the part of the Jew it was a flash of suspicion and alarm
that for an instant expanded his eyes and perceptibly
checked his movement. For an instant only. Then
came a new woodenness into his face, and he seemed to
retreat still further behind those small, half-closed eyes
which yet lost nothing of their watchful expression. So
on they came toward each other—the Greek unconsciously
increasing the dignity and firmness of his tread,
and keeping his eyes fixed on the approaching face as if
bent on improving to the utmost an unwelcome opportunity
for reading on that hard page whatever might be
read. So they met and passed. Cimon never looked behind<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[135]</a></span>
him. Had he done so he would have seen Malus
standing at the door of the office just left and looking
after him.</p>

<p>But the Greek did not need to see this. That steady
look into the face of Malus, though brief, was enough to
assure him that the suspicions of the man were all ablaze,
and that he would not rest till he had found out whatever
the custom-house chief could tell him. And probably he
would be successful in suppressing any further light from
that quarter. Cimon was thankful, however, that he
had secured as much as he had. He trusted that it
would be sufficient—perhaps it could be used to compel
more.</p>

<p>He was now more than ever impressed with the necessity
of hastening whatever further inquiries he had to
make. It was still high day—why not proceed at once
to the dealers in eastern goods whose addresses he had
jotted down at the khan, and try to find out what had
been the selling prices of eastern goods for as many years
as possible? Why not even improve the opportunity of
Malus’ absence from his warehouse to go there and see
what would be said by the subordinates when not overlooked
by the master? As soon as the idea suggested
itself, he accepted it. He would go to Nos. 110, 111,
112 Emporium Street first of all.</p>

<p>Accordingly, as soon as he had passed through the
Gate of the Moon, turning leftward into the Greek quarter
to lessen the chances of recognition, he proceeded
northward till he thought he might be opposite to the
warehouse of Malus, and then struck eastward into Emporium
Street again. His venture was successful. Before
him stood the establishment he was seeking. As<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[136]</a></span>
soon as he presented himself at the door he was politely
saluted by a young man and invited to enter. What
could he do for my lord?</p>

<p>My lord wished to be conducted to the chief man in
charge of the department of eastern goods.</p>

<p>“Certainly, it would be done with the greatest pleasure.
Would my lord be pleased to follow?”</p>

<p>This following took Cimon through a large part of
the establishment. He could well believe it to be the
largest warehouse in Alexandria. It was really an immense
bazaar. One could find there almost anything
that was bought and sold in the Roman world—from the
toys of infants up to the furnishings of a royal palace,
and even of a royal person. Messengers were hurrying
about, crowds were coming and going, salesmen were
crying out and displaying their goods from hundreds of
stalls. It was a tempest of assault on the pouches of visitors.
And many were evidently being captured.</p>

<p>The department to which Cimon at last came was
specially attractive. Here, in an air through which stole
the sweetness of the Indian nard and other costly aromatics,
were piled or suspended miracles of the loom and
needle, on some of which had been expended the labors
of a life-time—veils like sea-foams, embroideries to which
the glowing oriental fancy and patient fingers had transferred
landscape and legend and history and the starry
heavens; gold and silver brocade from beyond the
Ganges; silks, tapestries, housings, rugs, shawls from
Persia and Cashmere: the whole brightened and multiplied
wonderfully by polished steel mirrors judiciously
placed. At the centre of the department was the collection
of precious stones. In a compartment whose walls<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[137]</a></span>
were formed by suspended tapestries richly hued and pictured,
in a case whose beauty and strength seemed to
certify to the great value of its contents, lay pearls from
the Persian Gulf, emeralds from the Caucasus, diamonds
from the Oxus, turquoises from Medea, rubies from Bokhara,
and many other gems—all skillfully arranged into
a stony rainbow.</p>

<p>As Cimon passed close to the sparkling collection,
and lingered over it for a moment as he passed, it
struck him that the sparkle of some of the brilliants was
not exactly that of genuine stones. But he might be
mistaken. Something more than a passing glance is
needed to enable even an expert to identify paste in its
better specimens. But one thing he was quite sure of
by this time, and that was that the light in the establishment
was such as to make an accurate judgment of most
of the goods very difficult to an average customer, while
such as to set them off to the best advantage.</p>

<p>But he was now standing before the desk of the man
whom he came to see.</p>

<p>“You have this department in charge, I believe,”
said the Greek, as he courteously saluted a Jew who was
no longer young.</p>

<p>Receiving an affirmative bow, Cimon proceeded:</p>

<p>“I am here in behalf of a friend who is not living in
this city, to inquire the prices at which certain goods of
the very best quality can be obtained. If you will furnish
me with a large blank bill I will specify the articled
in writing.”</p>

<p>A large blank bill was readily handed to him, on
which he wrote a list of considerable length.</p>

<p>“Now will you oblige me,” said he, after having<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[138]</a></span>
carefully read over what he had written, “by setting
down opposite these several items the prices at which you
could furnish them to-day?”</p>

<p>The man’s eyes snapped as he looked over the long
list and saw how many expensive articles it included.
When he had set down prices as requested, and had
handed back the paper to Cimon, he said:</p>

<p>“The figures may seem to you somewhat large; but
they are for first-class goods. In fact, I have made the
prices smaller than they would be for small lots, considering
the length of your list.”</p>

<p>Cimon examined the paper carefully.</p>

<p>“The prices are unexpectedly large, I confess,” he
said gravely. “Have these goods risen in value lately?”</p>

<p>“By no means. The figures I have given you are
the lowest we have made in many years.”</p>

<p>“Then you have been in charge of this department
for a considerable time?”</p>

<p>“For twenty years.”</p>

<p>“Are these the bottom prices for so long a time as
that?”</p>

<p>“Just so.”</p>

<p>“You surprise me. Are you quite sure that there is
no mistake in this—that your memory serves you faithfully
in regard to so many years?”</p>

<p>“Perfectly sure,” with emphasis. “You see, all the
business of this department, so far as sales are concerned,
has been in my hands for the number of years I have
mentioned; and I remember perfectly that never during
all that time have we offered or sold such goods as these
at such low figures as I have written.”</p>

<p>“I think, then,” said Cimon, “it would be well for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[139]</a></span>
you to add as much to this paper. Would you object to
write at the bottom, ‘These are the lowest figures at
which the above goods have been sold for the last twenty
years?’”</p>

<p>“Not at all,” said the man—and wrote accordingly.</p>

<p>Cimon took the paper and courteously withdrew.</p>

<p>In very much the same manner and with like success
he dealt with several other establishments in the same
neighborhood—obtaining from each a written statement
of present prices and of how these compared, with the
prices of the years immediately preceding. The last
place he visited was that of Simeon Ben Simeon. Here,
for the first time, he saw himself recognized—Simeon
himself being present—and was received in a very cordial
way.</p>

<p>“We certainly are under great obligations to you and
that magnificent young friend of yours for your spirited
help yesterday in the synagogue. I have been quite desirous
to meet you again: especially as I saw that both of
you were much interested in my report of matters in
Judea, and, as I ventured to think, took very much the
same view of them as I did. Also, I have something
new to tell you.”</p>

<p>Simeon then gave the account with which we are already
familiar, as given to Aleph by Rachel. And, in
return, the Greek related what Shaphan had told him—keeping
back, however, the part that related to Malus.
And they rejoiced together.</p>

<p>“Tell me,” said Simeon suddenly, “about that
young man—you know whom I mean. Somehow he has
a way of walking into one’s confidence and affections
after a very wonderful fashion. Who is he?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[140]</a></span></p>

<p>Cimon smiled at this downrightness and furious
driving at the mark.</p>

<p>“For the present,” said he, “he is only the friend
and pupil of Cimon the son of Cimon. I may, however,
add that he is one who is quite worthy of the impression
he makes. The gold is solid. I have now known him
for twenty years—that is to say, ever since he was born—and
I have nothing but good and great things to say
of him. Is he my son? Of course not—as one can
easily see—but though not my son he is a remarkably
good substitute for one. I could hardly have a better.
And,” he added archly, “I think seriously of adopting
him.”</p>

<p>The Jew laughed at the cleverness of the Greek, and
forebore to press; only adding, “<em>I</em> could adopt him <em>without</em>
thinking seriously of it.”</p>

<p>As he rose to leave, Cimon said, “I am really sorry
that I cannot at present give you the information you
wish about my young friend. But I am under bonds.
His father only can release me, and that father is far
away. So I must confine myself to saying that, unlike
most plants which begin to wither as soon as they are
parted from the parent root, this plant daily freshens
into a larger life. I am the more sorry that I cannot go
beyond this, both because you have already given me information
of the highest value, and because I came here
for the very purpose of getting still further information
from you—provided you can consistently grant it. I
wish to get from the leading dealers in eastern goods in
this city the present selling prices of a number of articles—also
how these prices compare with those of as many past
years as possible. I have already obtained written statements<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[141]</a></span>
from all, save yourself, on whom I proposed to
call. Do you see any objection to giving me yours?”</p>

<p>“None in the world. Let me see your list.”</p>

<p>So in a few moments Cimon added another to his papers.
As Simeon handed it to him, he said:</p>

<p>“I think you can hardly have called on Malus to-day,
and yet he has the largest establishment of your sort in
the city. He would hardly care to give you such a paper
as this. He is much too deep for that.”</p>

<p>Without a word, the Greek singled out one from his
parcel of papers and passed it to the Jew—who as soon as
he had glanced it over, exclaimed:</p>

<p>“Where was Malus when this was given?”</p>

<p>“Absent.”</p>

<p>“Of course. <em>Of course</em> he was absent—as his deputy
will probably be when the master learns of his indiscretion.”</p>

<p>As Cimon had noticed no sign of recognition in
street or shop, save at Simeon’s, he had begun to feel
that perhaps his precautions had been unnecessary; so,
when he had taken leave of Simeon and saw how large a
part of the day still remained, instead of crossing directly
into the Greek quarter again and so proceeding homeward,
he turned northward on Emporium Street till he
came to the great square at the intersection with the
street of Canopus. Here, seeing a crowd that seemed
greatly interested with something in their midst, he
crossed over to them, and finally managed, by a patient
use of the impatience of others, to secure a place where
he could see what was going on.</p>

<p>And this was what was going on. A number of
street boys, altogether Jewish, were busy practicing a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[142]</a></span>
new game. They had drawn on the pavement with a
charred stick the ground plan of a large building which
Cimon at once recognized as the Diapleuston. Just before
him was an unmarked place for the principal door:
half way down on the left was a pile of boxes to stand for
the main <i>bema</i> with its canopy and lecturn: in front of
this stood a group of boys pretending to be in earnest
conversation among themselves. After this show had
continued for a while, all but two of the boys walked off
and squatted silently behind the boxes. The two boys
left continued the pantomime of conversation for a few
minutes, when a noise was heard and lo, another group
of boys who had been hid behind the fountain came
marching in at the door, two by two, with papyrus helmits
on their heads and long, sharpened sticks for
spears, trying to keep pace together in soldierly fashion,
and carrying in their midst, transfixed on an extra long
stick, a very ragged, dirty, and hideous doll. At the
head of this company swaggered, perhaps the best
dressed, but certainly the ugliest little rascal of the whole
lot. He had taken some pains to add to his natural accomplishments
such smutches of loveliness as a liberal
use of mud and charcoal could give, and would have
frightened his own father and mother. About his waist
was a rope for a sash: to this was attached a bit of papyrus
cut into the shape of a scabbard; in his hand he
flourished as sword a short strip of lath that had just
come from the shambles and was red enough to be the
sword of Mars.</p>

<p>This high and mighty captain at once led his company
straight to the two boys, surrounded them, and fell
to abusing them with his tongue as only a practiced<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[143]</a></span>
street Arab could do. On this, the other boys behind
the boxes hurried to the scene of action, and threw in a
liberal accompaniment of voice and gesture to swell the
interest of the occasion. Soon Captain Mars worked himself
into a tempest, flew at one of the two boys, with his
bloody weapon uplifted. The other boys so crowded
about the encounter with outstretched and swaying arms
as to confuse the view of the spectators; but in a few
moments they saw the mimic sword flying high in air,
and then its owner in close custody in process of being
marched helplessly toward the door, followed by his tatterdemalions
hanging their heads and staggering about
as they were pushed and pulled and cuffed by the screaming
and enthusiastic escort that hemmed them closely in.
At the door the leader was dismissed with a rousing box
on the ear which sent him off on a stagger, which finally
ended in a runaway toward the Roman quarter. His followers
each received a like compliment with a like result.</p>

<p>The spectators seemed to enjoy this conclusion
hugely. They cheered and gesticulated with great enthusiasm;
and when the hot chase took place they all
hurried off to keep it in view. The last to follow was a
man who had been standing just before Cimon. This
man, glancing right and left as if to make sure that the
ground was clear, directed his course across the square so
as to take on his way the two boys who had personated
Cimon and Aleph, and dealt each of them in passing a
thwack on the head that was none of the mildest. At
all events, it was not a mild wailing that the little fellows
set up. Luckily, however, Cimon had noticed the movements
of the man, and half divining his purpose, had followed
him so closely that he was near enough when the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[144]</a></span>
blows were given to follow them with prompt punishment.
The two hearty cuffs he gave the fellow were
quite equal in value to those he had administered, and
seemed very surprising. In the startled and inflamed
face that was suddenly turned toward him, Cimon recognized,
as he thought, Roman features, though considerably
disguised. Could it be that he had again encountered
the son of the Governor? But the man gave him
no opportunity for a closer examination. He went rapidly
off with a Latin oath and a fist-shaking that belonged
to all languages.</p>

<p>Cimon consoled the children with a friendly pat on
the head and a piece of money for each—such as he had
never before possessed. But they hardly needed this
consolation—they were so delighted with the summary
judgment on their oppressor. Smiles were already rippling
over their tearful faces like sunshine over a wet
landscape. And when the friendly look and touch and
money were added, their sorrows were all forgotten in a
caper of delight. But Cimon was really sorry that the
urchins had not chosen some other theme for their sport.</p>

<p>“Ten to one,” said he to himself, “this affair, with
liberal embellishments, will be carried straight to Bruchium,
and will still further stir up ill blood between the
sections. There will be trouble here before long. These
Jews are too reckless and provoking to be left alone. It
may be that their expectation of a conquering Messiah at
the door has something to do with their audacity.”</p>

<p>With such thoughts as these running through his
mind, he made his way homeward through the Greek and
Egyptian quarters. His thoughts ran, but his feet
walked—walked very leisurely; for so at this hour of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[145]</a></span>
day did most of the people; and he did not care to draw
attention to himself by doing differently from others.
Besides, he wished to study the people, as far as he could—without
being observed. And it is wonderful how
much some people can see without the appearance of seeing.
They could hardly see more if their heads were set
with a coronet of eyes. Do they divine the situation?
Do they absorb the facts lying about them at every pore
as they do heat and moisture? So it would seem. Cimon
belonged to this class of men. He did not stare, he did
not look this way and that, and sometimes turn about,
with curiosity flooding every feature and saying, “I am a
new-comer,” but he pursued his way with quiet and equal
steps and with “eyes that looked right on, and eyelids that
looked straight before him”—and yet nothing escaped
him; not even that shadow of a portly man just disappearing
within a shop on his left and that ragged little
urchin that almost immediately darted out of the same
and followed him at a little distance.</p>

<p>What should he do? A thought came to him as he
came to a baker’s shop. He turned in and called for a
loaf and some cakes—keeping an eye on the open door
while his parcel was being made up. Presently the little
ragamuffin appeared cautiously peeping within. Cimon
held out toward him a large, tempting cake, and beckoned.
The boy came in slowly, as if resisting an irresistible
magnet.</p>

<p>“Hungry, my lad?”</p>

<p>The hungry eyes and pinched features of the little fellow
answered the question before his bobbing head could
say <i>Yes</i>, as it was not slow to do.</p>

<p>“Had anything to eat to-day, my poor boy? Really,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[146]</a></span>
I do not believe you have,” he added pityingly, as he
looked more carefully into the thin, dirty face.</p>

<p>The face began to cry.</p>

<p>“And you had no money to buy food with—had
you?” inquired Cimon, as he softly patted the curly head.</p>

<p>“He said he would give me some money when I came
back,” said the boy.</p>

<p>“<em>Who</em> said it?” asked Cimon.</p>

<p>“The man who sent me to see where you were going.”</p>

<p>“He did not think I was going into a baker’s shop to
get you something to eat—did he? Come, sit right down
here on this bench and eat this loaf and these cakes.
Any more hungry ones at home?”</p>

<p>The boy at this began to sob, and at last broke into a
perfect canter of sobs. He muttered something which
Cimon had to bend low to make out.</p>

<p>“What, poor mother and little sister! Alas, alas—how
sorry I am! But do you sit here and eat this; and
when you have finished, the baker shall give you twice as
much to carry home to your hungry mother and sister,
for here is the money. If I could help, they should never
be hungry again.”</p>

<p>I do not know what the baker thought of this way of
treating the little beggar. But I know what the little
beggar thought. He highly approved. He soon dried
his tears in the presence of kind looks, kind words, and
kinder food. What a glorious appetite that was! And
while it was being satisfied, or at least gratified, our
friend quietly went his way—unshadowed.</p>

<h3>VII.<br />
<span class="smaller">THE MATRICULATION.</span></h3>

<p>Aleph was greatly interested in Cimon’s account of
his adventures—most of all in the story of Shaphan.
He determined to communicate it as soon as possible
to the daughter of Alexander. But when would it
be possible? On referring to his syllabus he found that
Seti would lecture early the next morning. He would
attend that lecture, and afterward would go to look after
the sick woman Miriam. Perhaps he would find Rachel
with her: if not he might learn when she was likely to
come, and so manage to meet her.</p>

<p>Before the third hour the next morning, both Cimon
and Aleph found themselves in the great lecture hall of
the Serapeum. The students came in scatteringly; but
at length the room was well filled, for Seti was popular
with the young men. This was owing partly to the
splendor of his lineage and office, which always weighs
much with even the most democratic young men; partly
to his repute as the heir of the mysterious wisdom of Old
Egypt; and partly to the wonderful contrast between his
years and the unabated vigor of both his bodily and intellectual
faculties. And then this son of the Pharaohs and
supreme Egyptian pontiff was fond of young men, reasonably
tolerant of their ways, and knew how to unite<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[150]</a></span>
familiarity with dignity in his intercourse with them.
But he was specially in favor with the dominant aristocratic
element. Some of the other teachers were new
men. Nobody knew who their fathers were. The patrician
young men from Rome and elsewhere declared that
they <em>had</em> no fathers. What had the Fabii and Claudii
and Scipios to do with such people?</p>

<p>Cimon and Aleph had taken seats well in the rear of
the hall. So they had opportunity to notice the bearing
of the young men as they came in. On the whole they
were pleased with it. While a few had the air of triflers
and coxcombs, and here and there one had the jaded look
that suggested late hours and early dissipation, the most
had in various degrees that regulated and purposeful air
which teachers like to see. Among the more thoughtful
and earnest looking Aleph noticed one of the two Romans
whom he had met at the banker’s. He also noticed
that the ages of the students seemed to average about the
same as his own.</p>

<p>Almost every one who entered seemed to notice the
new-comers; and soon there was considerable whispering
and passing to and fro among the young men—which
continued till Seti appeared. He stopped for a moment
to exchange salutations with our friends, and then conducted
them to a seat on the right of the bema. This
was the customary seat for newly matriculated persons:
and was greatly for the convenience of older collegians
who thus not only became promptly aware of a new arrival,
but could quietly study him up without the fatigue
and incivility of turning about in their seats for the purpose.
Of course it was at the expense of the lecture.
But never mind—there are some things more important<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[151]</a></span>
than lectures to young people; and one of them is the
discipline of guessing out characters from faces and bearing.</p>

<p>From the seat they now had the friends could see well
what they had not before noticed, viz., a small latticed
gallery just opposite to them from which came occasionally
some hints and glints of white draperies. Though
none of the schools of the time distinctly contemplated
the co-education of the sexes, there was nothing in public
opinion, especially at Alexandria, to hinder the daughters
of the professors and other approved ladies from
hearing the lectures given to the young men; though it
was thought best to place the beauties where they could
not be seen. The professors generally favored this invisible
presence as being conducive to good order and gentlemanly
conduct among the students. The chivalrous
instinct was not a medieval invention, nor even an invention
of Christianity. The students at the Serapeum in
the First Century knew that bright eyes were watching
them and behaved accordingly.</p>

<p>The lecture of Seti was on the ethics of truthfulness.
It was delivered with a grave and quiet dignity and authority
well befitting his years and station, and yet with
a subtle fire and force of thought and expression that
suited wonderfully youthful tastes. He had no manuscript
before him, nor did he seem to have one within
him from which he was reading; but he seemed to find
his thoughts in the faces and eyes of his hearers as his
keen glances went to and fro among them. And the
young men felt that they were being perused.</p>

<p>On the way home, the day before, Seti had informed
Aleph of a custom among the students. He had matriculated<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[152]</a></span>
with the <i>Faculty</i> of the University: the students
would ask him to matriculate also with themselves.
Each new-comer was not considered by them as invested
with full membership till they had examined him for
themselves and settled his grade among them as a collegian.
It was possible to avoid the ordeal, if he saw fit;
but a cheerful acceptance of it would conduce to popularity,
and, if the trial should be well sustained, would
give him a commanding influence. What would Aleph
prefer? Seti had asked with a shade of anxiety in his face.</p>

<p>“By all means,” Aleph had said with a smile, “let
not this custom be waived on my account. I rather fancy
the double matriculation.”</p>

<p>So he was not surprised when at the conclusion of the
lecture all the students retained their seats. He was,
however, somewhat surprised to see that Seti retained his
also. But he had no time to speculate on the matter:
for a fine looking young man at once came forward and,
courteously calling attention to the badge the stranger
wore, inquired whether he wished such further membership
and privileges among them as an examination by the
students would confer.</p>

<p>Aleph rose and as courteously replied that such was
his wish; and that he would not on any account have any
of the usual formalities omitted.</p>

<p>“This being so,” continued the young man, “your
full consent to our ancient custom having thus been graciously
conceded, I call on our committee for testing candidates
to come forward in proper order and discharge
their duty. I will only premise for your information
that the examination will ask two questions—first, <i>What
do you know?</i> and second, <i>What can you do?</i>”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[153]</a></span></p>

<p>Whereupon two young men presented themselves, and
one of them said, “I have the honor to put the first question—<i>What
do you know?</i>”</p>

<p>Aleph smiled.</p>

<p>“Excuse my smiling,” said he, “at the exceeding
largeness of your question, if I attempt to answer it, I
must begin with confessing that my knowledge is very
limited. Compared with what there is to be known, it
is practically nothing; compared with what I wish to
know it is very trifling indeed; perhaps further examination
may show that it is also very trifling in comparison
with what some of my fellow-students know,” and he
bowed to the young men. A ripple of laughter went
through the room.</p>

<p>“If you find my associate’s question,” said the other
member of the committee, “a little too large to be manageable,
perhaps you will tell us what you already know
of the various branches of knowledge preliminary to
those studied here. Doubtless you have informed yourself
as to our curriculum; it not being considered in general
a wise thing to leap into the dark.”</p>

<p>“This question,” returned Aleph, “is not indeed as
broad as the other; but still it would be hard to give you
a satisfactory answer (I mean one satisfactory to yourself,
for this I could wish to do) unless you will tell me what
branches of knowledge <em>you</em> consider preparatory to this
Institution. I fancy there might be a difference of opinion
as to that matter—after setting aside a few elementary
things. I can read and write and speak the Greek
and Latin languages after a fashion: have such acquaintance
with the literature in these tongues as, I should
hope, would enable me to understand such references to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[154]</a></span>
them as may occur in your lectures; have also had some
little practice in moral and mathematical reasoning, sufficient,
I should hope, for understanding a good argument
when presented. Is there any further preparation
needed? I have indeed heard (what I suppose to be true)
that a little knowledge of religion—some just and clear
ideas of Deity and duty and responsibility—is a good
thing in the way of preparation for university life. In
regard to that sort of knowledge, I can only say that if I
do not possess it the fault does not lie with my parents
or other teachers” (he slightly inclined his head toward
Cimon). “They have done their duty. But perhaps my
questioner does not lay any stress on this last sort of
knowledge as a valuable preliminary to the speculations
and associations of college life. It is even possible that
he considers it a decided disadvantage. I know that such
views are sometimes found among students.”</p>

<p>Aleph had drawn his bow at a venture. But the
broad wave of laughter that now swept through the hall
assured him that somebody had been hit. Was it not
the questioner himself, whose color had sensibly deepened?</p>

<p>His mate took up the broken thread. “Certainly we
did not all come here with as good a preparation as that:
but perhaps you have done more than the preparatory,
and already know considerably of the branches of study
which engage us here. Such advanced students often
come to us for various reasons.”</p>

<p>“I cannot say,” returned Aleph, “that I am altogether
ignorant of the subjects discussed here. It has
been my good fortune to have as teacher one who in his
youth passed much time in both the Athenian and Alexandrian<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[155]</a></span>
schools. And he has attempted, not as successfully
perhaps as he could wish, to put his own knowledge
into his pupil. What I know I owe to him and my
parents: what I do not know I owe to myself. Certainly
I do not come here because I know so much, but because
I know so little. I hope to enlarge my knowledge, such
as it is. In thirty years not a few changes must have
taken place here—new teachers have come to the front,
new ways of presenting and illustrating old truths are
used, and it is barely possible that some things then considered
branches of knowledge are now known to be
branches of ignorance. So I hope to profit. Is this satisfactory?
or would the committee like to have me explain
a syllogism, epitomize Plato or Aristotle or Zeno,
or expound the astronomy of Pythagoras?” just the
glimmer of an amused expression stealing from his eye.</p>

<p>“Not either of these,” answered the committee.
“Doubtless you are well prepared on what you voluntarily
offer. Allow us to ask you for something which, as
it is wholly unprecedented on such occasions as this, you
can hardly have made special preparation for. We will
ask you for an epitome of the lecture to which we have
just listened. This is a compliment we owe to our venerable
teacher who, I think, has never before honored us
with his presence on a similar occasion.”</p>

<p>Turning to Seti, Aleph expressed a hope that he
would excuse any injustice that might be done to his
lecture under such a stress of circumstances, and then
proceeded as follows:</p>

<p>“The lecture was on the ethics of truthfulness. It
held up to abhorrence the general character of a liar and
hypocrite; and said that men must tell what seems<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[156]</a></span>
truth to them whenever they profess to tell it. In war,
hostile forces do not profess to tell the truth to each
other, but the contrary: the very fact of war certifies to
all that feints, stratagems, deceptions of all sorts will be
used, and they are just as proper as war itself. Under
certain circumstances one can properly <em>withhold</em> truth
from his neighbor without notice given. No man is
bound to tell all he knows to all sorts of persons without
regard to how they will use the information. A glass
house would not be a good one to live in—especially
where stones and sinners are plenty. Silence is often
both the privilege and duty of a man, as well as his wisdom.
Deity himself keeps back much truth permanently
from us, and chooses his own times and ways for revealing
other truth. In the interest of justice we can properly
make inquiries which, if their object were known,
would not be answered: we can be silent on what criminals
have no right to know. In government, in business,
in social intercourse a measure of reticence is indispensable
to the wisest living, and even to righteousness.
Without notice given, one may never affirm what he
thinks to be false: he may without notice sometimes
keep back what he knows to be true. These positions
were defended by considerations drawn from natural conscience,
the general voice of mankind, the testimonies of
illustrious teachers, and the grave difficulties that would
arise were the world to accept and act upon other principles.”</p>

<p>Aleph folded his arms and looked inquiringly at the
committee. The committee looked inquiringly at Seti.</p>

<p>“May we ask the venerable Seti whether this is a satisfactory
account of his lecture?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[157]</a></span></p>

<p>He bowed assent: and a general cheer went up from
the benches.</p>

<p>“I perceive,” said the master of ceremonies, “that it
is the mind of our community that I pronounce the first
part of the examination well sustained. Accordingly I
so pronounce.”</p>

<p>Another round of applause.</p>

<p>The young man continued, addressing Aleph, “As
you have doubtless perceived, our object has been not so
much to find out how much you know as your powers of
knowing. I think we have gotten sufficient light on
that point. May we get as much on the point that still
remains to be inquired into, viz., your powers of <em>doing</em>.
Our community lay considerable stress on physical accomplishments,
and, we think, with good reason. An
efficient mind does its best in an efficient body. We but
follow the traditions of more classical times when we ask
whether you can run and ride and row, can leap and lift
and shoot and wrestle and fence—in short, protect your
mother and sisters and such maiden as the gods may give
you.”</p>

<p>“I have had some teaching in all these matters,” replied
Aleph: “whether I have duly profited by the
teaching it does not become me to say.”</p>

<p>“Are you willing to appear in our palæstra for a testing;
and if so, do you choose to compete with the good
or the better or the best in each department?”</p>

<p>“I am willing to appear: and defeat would be less
mortifying to me at the hands of the best,” said Aleph
with infinite composure.</p>

<p>“But one thing remains to be attended to here,” continued
Publius Cornelius (for this was the name of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[158]</a></span>
young Roman who acted as master of ceremonies). “According
to our rules, when a young man has elected the
best competitors—which indeed rarely happens—it is
necessary that he stand face to face with them in our
presence, that he may fully understand what he undertakes,
and have an opportunity to recede from his choice
if he thinks best: also that we may judge whether his
choice is a reasonable one. Our best will now please
present themselves with the candidate in front of the
bema.”</p>

<p>A number of young men rose in different parts of the
hall, and made their way to the open space before Seti.
Aleph also advanced and stood near, facing them.</p>

<p>There was a profound silence for a few moments as
the confronting parties surveyed each other, and were
closely surveyed and compared by the rest (many standing
on their seats for the purpose). Then burst out an
almost deafening cheer.</p>

<p>The fact was that as long as Aleph stood by himself
his extraordinary physical advantages had not fully displayed
themselves. But when he came to stand with
others everybody at once saw that in that group there
was no face so noble and winning, no figure so majestic
and exquisitely proportioned, no bearing so lofty and
poised and full of suggestion of power and leadership as
Aleph’s. So evident was all this to the “best” themselves
that they could not prevent the consciousness of it
from appearing in their uneasy faces and attitudes—especially
after that spontaneous cheer which they well understood.</p>

<p>“Well?” inquired Cornelius, looking at Aleph.</p>

<p>Aleph again passed his eyes naturally and serenely<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[159]</a></span>
through the group before him, resting them for an instant
on one taller and brawnier than the rest, and then
said quietly, “I adhere to my choice.”</p>

<p>A young man started up. “Our president has stated
that we are to judge of the reasonableness of this choice.
It seems to me a very unreasonable one. The advantages
are too much on one side. Unless the gods interfere
(and somehow they are not apt to do so in these days)
there can be but one result to such an unequal competition.
It is foreordained. I therefore propose, in the interest
of our Best, that the candidate be at once passed
to his matriculation with all the honors and with no
conditions whatever. This course, it is true, is unprecedented;
but then the circumstances are unprecedented.
Those of us who know a good thing when we see it, are,
I think, quite prepared for this action.”</p>

<p><i>Action</i>, <i>Action</i> was exclaimed from all parts of the
hall.</p>

<p>Cornelius stepped on a bench, and looking about the
assembly called out, “Is there any objection on the part
of any to the course which Quintius Fabius proposes?”</p>

<p>After waiting a moment for responses that did not
come, the president proceeded, “Let every one who regards
the examination as already sufficient, and would at
once admit the candidate to full membership in our body,
stretch forth his hand.”</p>

<p>And <em>such</em> a showing of hands! They flew out and up
as if from a catapult. Some voted with two hands.
Some, not content with a simple uplifting, made their
hands shake and triumph in the air. Even the Best
voted with the rest.</p>

<p>“Your mind is clear,” cried the president. “By<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[160]</a></span>
your vote, and without dissent, this gentleman is now a
member in full of this university. In your name” (as he
advanced toward Aleph with outstretched hand) “I, Publius
Cornelius, offer greetings and fellowship to”—and
he hesitated.</p>

<p>“Aleph the Chaldean,” said Aleph, as he gracefully
took the proffered hand.</p>

<p>Seti remained sitting for a while longer, keenly
watching, as many of the young men gathered about
Aleph and were introduced to him by Cornelius. Among
these were the Best; who were at first somewhat backward
and awkward, but whom Aleph so welcomed with
frank and unpretending cordiality that they were soon
quite at ease. Seti watched and admired. He saw that
the young man had quite won those who might easily
have become his enemies—in short had fairly conquered
the position he had coveted for him.</p>

<p>Aleph lingered till the other students had left that he
might inquire of Seti whether he had heard from Miriam
that morning. He had not; but was not sure but that
he might hear something by going to his rooms. Would
not Aleph and his friend accompany him?</p>

<p>As they approached the apartments of the high-priest
they saw before them in the distance what seemed the
fluttering of female robes: and, as soon as Seti had
opened his door, he found himself in the arms of his
granddaughter.</p>

<p>“Mother-father” (this was her favorite style of address),
she exclaimed, looking up fondly into his face,
“are you not very tired after such a long session? But
what a good lecture that was, and then....”</p>

<p>“Ah, child,” he hastily interrupted as he patted her<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[161]</a></span>
cheek, “what a flatterer you are! Why not begin to
practice on my lecture by telling me the truth? Tired!
Antiquity is never tired. The tired ones are your moderns—such
young men as you may see behind me.”</p>

<p>Cimon was surprised at the magnificent beauty that
now disengaged herself from the arms of Seti and stood
blushing before them. Aleph had indeed spoken of her
as beautiful, but with no particularity and effusion: and
so he was not prepared for the lovely vision. It seemed
to him for a moment as if he had before him one of the
Hellenic goddesses—a sort of compound of Aphrodite and
Athene and Artemis. As to Aleph—such a look of glad
recognition sprang to his face at the unexpected meeting
that she could not but notice it. It gave her courage to
advance and give her hand to Cimon, saying, “The
daughter of Alexander gratefully remembers our friend
of the Diapleuston”—to then turn to Aleph with a welcoming
look and a new flush on her cheek as she said,
“You see one has to make much of her grandfather, especially
when she has but one. Perhaps you, too, have
a mother-father and know how good it is to have him.”</p>

<p>“The lady has guessed rightly,” returned the young
man. “The last thing I did when leaving my country
was to bow my tearful face on the shoulder of a white-haired
man whose form was not bent, nor eye dim, nor
natural force abated, though he had long passed his century;
and who laid his hand on my head and sent me
away with the blessing of a grand sire. God willing, I
shall see him again. The mother-fathers of Chaldea live
long.”</p>

<p>“May the God of Chaldean Abraham grant it,” said
the maiden devoutly.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[162]</a></span></p>

<p>“And grant also that I may carry back to him the
news he has so long waited for—that the Desire of all nations
has at last come!”</p>

<p>“Amen,” said Rachel; “and, according to my promise,
I have something new to tell you touching that matter.
So come with me, all of you—I mean <em>you</em>, mother-father,”
and she threw a graceful gesture at Seti as she
led the way to seats near a window.</p>

<p>While the young people had been talking, Seti, with
folded arms, had kept his eyes fastened on them as if by
some irresistible attraction. Rousing himself at the call
of Rachel, he said to Cimon with a smile, “In these days
the Egyptian is in bondage to Israel,” and added as he
closed the door and followed, “and is not very discontented—certainly
not enough to make an exodus.”</p>

<p>When they were seated, Rachel said to Aleph, “I
promised that if I obtained any new facts about Jesus I
would communicate them to you. And this is what I
have heard this morning.”</p>

<p>She then proceeded to say that on her way to the
Serapeum she had seen Miriam, found that her husband
had not appeared, found that she had improved so much
that she was able to tell her sad story since her marriage.
She had first gone with her husband to Tyre, where he
professed to have property. After a few days he removed
her to a small house near the city. This was the first of
a succession of removals east and south. They never
stopped long in a place—never lived in any but the poorest
and obscurest part of a place. She never knew her
husband do any work, or seek for any. She often wondered
at first how he obtained such scanty and irregular
supplies as they had. Once when she asked him about<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[163]</a></span>
the matter, he said that he was living on his property;
and accompanied the information with such a storm of
abuse that she never after dared to refer to the subject.
She did not need to do so. He was abroad much at
night; and she noticed that when abroad during the day
he shunned thoroughfares, and sometimes disguised himself.
Moreover, the men whom he brought to the house
were of the lowest sort, and she could not well avoid
overhearing enough of their talk to assure her that they
agreed in thinking that property was robbery and might
be taken wherever it could be found. After the first few
weeks he cast off all semblance of regard for her. He
would often leave her for weeks without any means of
support; and had it not been for the compassion of the
poor people about her she would have starved. As it
was, her suffering from exposure, privation, and remorse
reduced her almost to a skeleton. Ah, what days those
were! She shuddered when she spoke of them. Such
wretched living as they had was gotten by robbery, and
sometimes by murder. He no longer pretended the contrary.
She came to know that their frequent changes of
place were made necessary by his crimes. As soon as he
found himself an object of suspicion, he went to a new
place and there repeated his thefts and burglaries until
his safety required him to move on. In this way they
slowly drifted from the Phenician coast to the Sea of
Galilee.</p>

<p>She now thinks that she could not have lived through
that awful pilgrimage had it not been for one thing.
Wherever she went she met with poor people who had
been cured of some incurable ail by the new prophet
Jesus—cured by a touch or a word. Sometimes it was a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[164]</a></span>
palsy, sometimes consumption, sometimes leprosy, sometimes
blindness or deafness or a lost limb, sometimes
devils or death. And he asked nothing in return for
such wonderful deliverances. Of course all mouths were
full of his praises. They told of his gentle and compassionate
ways; how he did not disdain publicans and sinners,
saying that he came to seek and save the lost: how
he took little children in his arms and caressed and
blessed them; how patiently and wisely and wonderfully
he taught the humblest as well as the highest—told of
such things till her heart burned and ached to see him,
to be near him, to pour out her oppressed soul into his
pitiful ears.</p>

<p>At last her wish was accomplished. One day, while
they were living at Chorasin, after some new tempest of
abuse and wickedness from her husband, she slipped away
into the fields to give vent to her grief and despair.
There she saw in the distance a number of people on an
eminence: and, on mounting a rock, she saw that others
were moving toward the eminence from all directions. It
flashed upon her that perhaps Jesus had come, and that
now was her opportunity. She at once made for the hill—determined
that if indeed Jesus was there she would
get as near to him as possible. She felt as if some
mighty loadstone was drawing upon her. Being unencumbered,
she sped along quickly, passed many who were
carrying sick people or were sick themselves, and was not
long in assuring herself that it was indeed Jesus toward
whom all the streams of infirmity and suffering were setting.</p>

<p>She quickened her steps into a desperate haste. She
flew rather than ran—flew to the side of the hill where<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[165]</a></span>
the people were fewest, pressed through them as if on an
errand of life and death, saw one who was plainly the
central figure, fell down before him panting, disheveled,
eyes streaming, and tried to look up through her tears
into his face. And she dimly saw there such gentleness,
such pity, such insight, such power, that a great wave of
rest swept in on her soul as she murmured, <i>Lord, thou
knowest</i>. And he answered, in a voice strangely sweet,
that somehow seemed to penetrate every fibre of her being.</p>

<p>“Yes, I know, thou daughter of many sorrows.
Wait patiently for the hour of deliverance which will
come in thy own country by the hands of those whom I
will send. Meanwhile go in peace—thy sins be forgiven
thee.”</p>

<p>She rose—all the harshness and bitterness of her
soul gone, a calmness and strength and peace within that
were indescribable. She did not withdraw from the
scene; only fell back among the crowd. And there she
saw with her own eyes the wonderful things done of
which she had been hearing ever since she landed in
Tyre. It seemed as if the whole country about had
searched out its desperate cases and brought them together
to test his power and pity. And she saw that no
case was beyond him. Not an ail in all the throng but
had instant relief as he touched or spoke. The number
and variety of the miracles almost took her breath away.
When the last sufferer had been helped she could no
longer contain herself, but, as if filled and pressed irresistibly
by a heavenly breath, burst forth with song, “O
give thanks unto the Lord, for he has done marvellous
things:” and all the people joined their voices to hers
till the country side rang.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[166]</a></span></p>

<p>She went back to her husband, but not to her misery.
The memory of that look, and that voice, and that promise
was like a strong man under her cross. Her husband
was no better; they still drifted from place to place, but
always with a compulsion by circumstances toward the
south and west. Her strength grew less as they approached
the seacoast, and quite broke down at Joppa as
she saw her husband, as he was hurrying her aboard a
vessel for Alexandria in the night, rob and kill a man;
yet even then the memory of that divine hour in Galilee
was a mighty peace in her heart, and she felt that she was
on her way to deliverance.</p>

<p>Said Seti to Rachel, after the few moments of profound
silence that followed her narrative, “Did you ever
notice in Miriam in former days any tendency to—exaggeration?”</p>

<p>“Never,” she replied. “On the contrary, Miriam
was noted for great care not to overstate facts. You may
depend upon it, grandfather, she is fully up to the
standard of your lecture.”</p>

<p>Seti seemed not to notice this sally, and the accompanying
shadow of a smile that flitted across the shining
face, but said, “To say nothing of his marvellous deeds,
the attention which Jesus pays to the lowly and uninfluential,
rather than to the great and powerful, is very unlike
what one would expect in a scheming impostor.”</p>

<p>“That he is not that,” said Aleph, “is still further
confirmed by what my preceptor and friend here heard
yesterday. I am sure you will agree with me if he will
tell the substance of what Shaphan of the gate of Canopus
related.”</p>

<p>All wished to hear. So Cimon proceeded to relate<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[167]</a></span>
the story of Shaphan—omitting, however, the circumstances
bearing on Malus, and one or two other particulars.</p>

<p>When he had finished, Rachel exclaimed, “How wonderful
all this is! Surely there is but one thing to be
said, unless we are prepared to discredit all human testimony!
I have heard my father speak of Shaphan as a
very good man: I must see him and ask him many questions.”</p>

<p>“Would it not be better,” said Seti, “to first question
some expert magician as to what he can do by his
art? It is not incredible that there should be beings between
the Supreme and ourselves who can do very wonderful
things.”</p>

<p>“No, my dear grandfather; but if these superior beings
are good they will not lend themselves to a great religious
imposture; and if they are bad they would fight
against themselves by endorsing such teaching and doing
such works as those of Jesus. Would Satan cast out
Satan?”</p>

<p>“Hardly. Still, have not magicians sometimes been
good men? Perhaps our friends here can throw some
light on that matter. Time has been when Chaldea was
famous for its magicians”—and Seti looked toward
Aleph.</p>

<p>“In my country, as in Egypt,” said Aleph, “the
name magicians has always been used to cover all students
of extensive knowledge, especially all students of
the powers and processes of Nature. As to such persons
as profess by certain arts to enlist the powers of mightier
spirits in their service there is, at least at present, but
one opinion among us, and that a very unfavorable one.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[168]</a></span>
It is that of the Hebrew Scriptures which denounce and
forbid all magical arts under heavy penalties. However
it may be with others, those who profess to accept these
Scriptures and at the same time use magical arts, it
seems to me, cannot be good men, or other than very
bad. This is the case of Jesus. As I understand it, he
professes to hold faithfully by Moses and the prophets.
This being so, if he is a magician he is one of the worst
of men—especially as he solemnly declares that he works
his wonders not by magic, but by God.”</p>

<p>“And consequently,” added Cimon, “all evidence we
have that he is one of the best of men is evidence that he
is not a magician.”</p>

<p>“And what evidence of this sort have we?” asked Seti.</p>

<p>“At least we can say,” returned the Greek, “that no
evidence <em>against</em> Jesus has yet reached us, while we have
heard much for him. We have heard that his miracles
are wholly beneficent and his teachings wholly righteous;
and that the worst thing his enemies can say of
him is that he does the very thing the prophets said the
Christ would do, viz., stoop to the humblest while claiming
with the highest. For myself, I would also lay considerable
stress on the impression which the mere personal
presence of Jesus makes on such a man as Shaphan.
It is plain to me that this man would profoundly
believe in the worth of Jesus, even if he had not seen a
single miracle of his, nor heard from him a single word.
Is this unreasonable? Two or three times in the course
of my life, I have been similarly impressed—I have had
merely to look into the eye and watch for a few moments
the play of the features to get an immovable confidence
in the character that lay behind them. Ordinary goodness,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[169]</a></span>
I confess, does not manifest itself in this royal way;
nor does extraordinary, except under certain physical organizations;
but there <em>are</em> organizations through which
it is self-revealing—through which it looks forth as
through pure crystal and shines by its own light, as does
any mathematical axiom—through which it is able to put
forth a heavenly atmosphere into which at least a sympathetic
soul cannot enter without feeling its heavenly
character.”</p>

<p>“So it seems to me,” said Seti. “I, too, have met a
case or two of that sort.”</p>

<p>“The venerable Seti,” said Aleph; “has doubtless
met with many so-called magicians in this land of the
strange and mysterious. May I ask whether he has ever
met one who has <em>claimed</em> to do his prodigies through the
Supreme God, or to do them in such vast variety and
magnificence as are conceded to Jesus?”</p>

<p>“Certainly not,” answered the Egyptian; “and I
am quite sure that if we could get together all the professors
of the magical art that are or have been, they
could not, all together, make out such a list of wonders as
is conceded to Jesus.”</p>

<p>“I would also ask of the venerable Seti,” continued
Aleph, “if he will not express his views more fully as to
the suggestion of the lady Rachel, viz., that it is incredible
that bad spirits of vast intelligence would lend their
powers to give currency and authority to a system of
teaching whose whole stress they must see to be to defeat
and destroy their influence.”</p>

<p>“It <em>is</em> incredible. She only needs to show that the
teaching of Jesus is plainly and thoroughly against the
feelings and objects of evil spirits.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[170]</a></span></p>

<p>“Why, my dear grandfather, all the accounts agree
that Jesus teaches altogether in the line of our Scriptures,
though with new fullness and illustrations—and no
one knows better than you how holy the teachings of our
Sacred Books are—exposing the devices of Satan, denouncing
him and all his works, calling to watchfulness
and prayer against him, rebuking and casting out his demons,
assailing the very foundation of his kingdom in
disloyalty to God, binding our consciences to a perpetual
war on sin in both life and heart, threatening it with the
terrors of an avenging heaven.”</p>

<p>Seti inclined his head gravely toward the maiden,
whose earnestness was now glowing in her face and adding
to it new charms, but was silent.</p>

<p>“The lady has expressed my thought,” said Cimon.
“It used to be a part of the Roman law, and I presume
is so still, that when a man is accused of doing what
would neither suit his passions nor his interests, the accusation
may be dismissed at once. It is incredible.
Neither men nor devils act against all motive.”</p>

<p>“Now, great teacher,” cried Rachel, “it is time to
sum up, as you do sometimes in your lectures; and (she
brightly shook her finger at Seti) be careful to sum up
on the right side.”</p>

<p>“Which of course means <em>your</em> side,” said the Egyptian,
with a slight lifting of his eyebrows.... Well,
how will this please you?</p>

<p>“Jesus, it is universally conceded, has done many
things far beyond mere human power: he claims for
them a divine origin: they are worthy of such an origin
in the grandeur and beneficence of their character: such
an origin agrees with certain ancient predictions apparently<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[171]</a></span>
relating to these times: unless they have such an
origin, neither had the miracles of Moses and the other
prophets; and indeed it seems impossible for God to furnish
reliable credentials to any messenger; for, so far as
we can see, his credentials must be miracles and could
not well be greater miracles than Jesus has wrought: unless
they have a divine origin they are demoniacal—which
is wholly inconsistent with the apparent (say certain)
character of Jesus and also with his teachings, which are
such as no evil spirit could reasonably be supposed willing
to promote.... Is this satisfactory?”—turning
to Rachel.</p>

<p>“I think you could do better; but that will do—will
do very well for the present,” she returned smiling;
“especially as you have gratuitously supplied some missing
links to the chain. Go on, O illustrious house of
Seti and heir of all the Pharaohs, I have great hopes of
you yet.”</p>

<p>“You see, gentlemen,” said Seti, “what comes of
teaching our daughters to know and argue like other people.
As soon as we furnish them with arms they turn
them against us. And this they call gratitude!”</p>

<p>“But,” he added gravely, seeing Cimon rising to
take leave, “if your affairs now call you away I wish to
make an inquiry of you—if you will step this way.”</p>

<p>Cimon followed him to a distant part of the room.</p>

<p>After a little hesitation, Aleph said to Rachel, “Your
grandfather has surprised me very much in this conversation.
From the position he holds I should have thought
such views on his part impossible.”</p>

<p>“There is a mystery about the matter, I confess,” replied
the maiden; “but then this is not the only righteous<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[172]</a></span>
mystery in Alexandria to-day”—and her eyes
laughed into his in a very wonderful way.</p>

<p>“Let us hope,” said he with an answering gleam
from eyes quite as wonderful though mysteriously different,
“that they both will clear up satisfactorily in due
time, as the mystery of Jesus seems to be doing. I am
grateful to you for what I have heard to-day. But I would
be glad to speak with Miriam myself. Do you think she
will be strong enough to bear another talk to-day?”</p>

<p>“Perhaps so. I return to her as soon as my sedan
comes; and if you will accompany me we will see what
she is equal to. If you do not object, I wish to be present
when you question her.”</p>

<p>“That would be delightful to me (and a new light
sprang to his eyes as he said it)—especially since I have
come to know that you have mind as well as beauty, and
can inquire and reason with the best.”</p>

<p>He said this as if half soliloquizing, and with such an
air of glad heartiness that she at once felt that the words
had in them nothing of the emptiness of mere compliment.</p>

<p>She hastened to say timidly, “If we find that she is
not able to talk with us to-day, we can arrange to see her
to-morrow when she is fresh. Perhaps, too, she will then
be able to bear removal to our house and—could I count
on your aid in transferring her, for my brothers are away
and my father has gone to Rome?”</p>

<p>“How gladly I agree to this the lady Rachel, I trust,
already knows. At the same time, I must confess, I
have some doubt as to what the morrow may bring
to me; and so I would fain do as much as I can to-day.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[173]</a></span></p>

<p>“You do not mean—I trust you do not mean <em>danger</em>?”
and she looked anxiously at him.</p>

<p>Before he could answer a knock was heard at the door
and a servant entered to say that the sedan of the lady
was waiting at the gate. Rachel hastily prepared for the
street. Going to Seti, who now stood by the door, she
kissed him and—stood embarrassed.</p>

<p>“Well, what is it, my Gem of Alexandria?” said
Seti. “What can we do for you? Do you want the old
man to send you off with a formal blessing? The blessing
of a heathen is not worth very much.”</p>

<p>“You are no heathen,” rejoined the maiden; “and
I have already a great store of your blessings carefully
laid up at home among my treasures. Give your blessing
to-day to these friends of ours who, I fear, are in danger,
and who have deserved well at our hands. You are wise
and powerful—protect them, or you and I will have to
part company. I hate ingratitude”—and she shook her
finger at him.</p>

<p>“By the way,” she added, “do you think that so valuable
a jewel as the Gem of Alexandria ought to pass
along the street without an escort?”</p>

<p>“I was about to offer the lady my escort on her way
as far as Miriam, whom I wished to question: but it
seems that I am a person who himself needs protection,”
said Aleph with a smile.</p>

<p>“Judging from what we have seen, Aleph the Chaldean
is remarkably well qualified to protect himself, to
say nothing of others,” said Seti with great composure.</p>

<p>“Yes, against a fair enemy,” protested the maiden;
“but against others one needs all the help he can get
from both earth and heaven. What I want of you,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[174]</a></span>
grandfather, is to see that earth does its part. If you do
not, I promise you that you shall see how a woman can
bestir herself.”</p>

<p>“Just as if Seti needed all this eloquence, child!” he
said reproachfully.</p>

<p>“Mother-father, I am ashamed of myself. I know
that you mean nobly. But then you men are so manly that
you are not so quick as a woman at divining the presence
of danger, though far better at meeting it when discovered.
At least, so I am told; and I shall not deny it till
necessary. So forgive me, and—do as I say.”</p>

<p>“I am not sure,” said the Egyptian thoughtfully,
“but that both of you are right. If Rachel must return
by way of Miriam an escort may be a protection to her,
as Antis is capable of the worst; and to be seen in the
streets with the daughter of Alexander may in the end
be a protection to Aleph the Chaldean, for it will show
whom it may concern that he is not without friends. So
go, you two—but I will ask our friend Cimon to remain
a while longer.”</p>

<h3>VIII.<br />
<span class="smaller">THE ESCORT.</span></h3>

<p>In going to the Serapeum, our friends had noticed near
the gate of the khan the Cretan who, as agent for
Malus, had dealt with the Phenician dealer in dyes. They
recognized him readily, though he turned hastily away as
they approached him. The <em>catspaw of Malus!</em> they
both thought; and would perhaps have thought no more
of it had not——</p>

<p>But, on going a little farther, whom should they see
but Malus himself coming toward them! They could not
be mistaken—the same obese figure, the same waddling
gait, the same wooden face and gimlet eyes. He stopped
almost immediately at a fruiterer’s stall, and seemed busy
in selecting some fruit as they passed. After they had
passed he turned and watched them. They did not turn
to notice the fact, but they knew it all the same—knew
that Malus had tracked them to their quarters and made
sure of a close connection between them.</p>

<p>When Aleph came out with Rachel to her sedan, he
very naturally looked about to see if he was still under
surveillance. But he saw only the porters of the rich
conveyance that waited for the daughter of Alexander.
Nor did he, on the way to Miriam’s, as he walked by the
side of the chair and occasionally exchanged a word with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[178]</a></span>
its inmate, observe anything but that courteous general
observation which a very distinguished looking man in
honorable attendance on a great lady might be expected
to draw.</p>

<p>There was one interruption on the way—a pleasant
one. Rachel, through her curtains, happening to descry
Shaphan at a distance, stopped her bearers and begged
Aleph to beckon the Jew to them. He promptly crossed
the street. The lady gave him her hand and said that
she had been hearing with great interest the story of his
visit to Judea, but wished to hear it again at first hand.
Could he not go with them a short distance to where her
nurse lived and there gratify her? He could: in fact,
his brother, who had just returned from Judea, and himself
were even now returning from the Egyptian khan
near the Serapeum, whither they had gone for the purpose
of seeing the young Chaldean (he bowed to Aleph) and
his friend, and communicating some new information
about the Messiah.</p>

<p>Aleph expressed his gratification at the meeting, and
warmly seconded the lady’s request. So Shaphan beckoned
to his brother, and the two followed the chair to the
house of Miriam.</p>

<p>They found the door guarded by a stout servant of
Alexander, and by bars still stouter. It appeared that
Antis had lately been there, demanded admittance, and,
on being refused, had become violent, tried to break open
the door, and finally had gone away threatening to return
shortly with authority and force that could not be resisted.</p>

<p>Aleph suggested that the sedan be brought within the
house. Should violence be used it might be well to add
the porters to the resisting force.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[179]</a></span></p>

<p>They found that Miriam had been so agitated by the
attempt of her husband that she was unfit for the further
conversation that Aleph desired. But with so many
friends now about her she was in a restful state; and
when Rachel proposed that, if it would not tire her too
much, Shaphan and his brother should give an account
of their visit to Palestine and Jesus, she declared that she
could well endure it. Indeed, it would strengthen her.
To hear of Jesus again would be as cool water to a thirsty
soul.</p>

<p>So Shaphan told again the story with which we are
already familiar—told it, however, with omission of the
part relating to Malus; for Aleph had suggested that all
the servants, excepting the door-keeper, should be present
at the recital. “This was a matter that concerned everybody.”</p>

<p>When Shaphan had finished, his brother Nathan
added substantially the following account:</p>

<p>After the departure of his brother, he had remained a
few days longer with Jesus, listening to his teaching and
seeing further examples of his wonderful power. Two of
these examples were specially impressive.</p>

<p>One day, as the night drew on, Jesus, who had been
teaching the people from a boat belonging to his disciples,
was overheard saying to them, <i>Let us go over to the other
side</i>. Whereupon they put out into the lake and headed
for Gadara. Some of his hearers, of whom Nathan was
one, hating to part company with him for even a short
time, immediately sprang into another boat and followed.
Soon the night shut down—one of the blackest nights
ever known. Jesus’ boat could no longer be seen. Suddenly
the wind rose into a gale. It wrestled with the sea<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[180]</a></span>
like a giant; and the sea rose in its wrath and wrestled
back again with a mighty outcry. For a moment they
would lie breathless in each other’s arms; and then, reviving,
fling themselves madly at each other in mortal
duel. It was an awful scene. It seemed as if all the
demons were abroad. The waters which, when they embarked,
were almost without discernible wrinkle, were now
furrowed into mighty chasms by the plow of the storm
king. Up went the little boat to heaven on the thundering
billow; down it went into a hell of waters as thunderous.
The watery monsters shook their white manes
and lashed their black sides and leaped at and over their
prey with open jaws. They laughed to scorn oar and
rudder and seamanship. They shouted, and howled and
shrieked, and seemed to swear by the Eternal to the helpless
crew, “We have you now; nothing can save you; to-morrow
your corpses will be drifting silently about; no,
nothing can save you, not even the mighty Christ.” Such
blaspheming, frantic, frightful madhouse of the elements—who
ever saw the like! Not Nathan and his
companions. It seemed to them as if hell had emptied
itself on the sea of Galilee; and that all the fiends, astride
of whirlwinds and crested billows, were fiercely battling
together for the privilege of drowning every living thing.
They struggled. They prayed. They were in despair.
Drenched, rudderless, oarless, they clung to the sides of
the fast filling boat in a paroxysm of horror and helplessness.
In a few moments all would be over. They commended
their souls to God.</p>

<p>What noise was that? Off at their right, hidden in
the darkness, evidently was another crew of affrighted
and sinking men, crying out in their extremity. Can<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[181]</a></span>
they be Jesus and his disciples? Are they too in the very
jaws of death? Cannot he who has done such great
things manage to save his own, to save himself? Or are
these raging, howling elements a field to which his power
does not extend? Such thoughts flashed through the
mind of Nathan even as he seemed on the point of being
swallowed up. But just then he distinctly heard (for the
boats had neared each other) a distressful voice which he
recognized as that of one of the disciples, exclaiming,
<i>Lord, save us, we perish!</i></p>

<p>“Can he do it? If so, why has he not interfered
before? Why permit such a horrible fright to his
friends? No, he cannot do it. Jesus has at last found his
master. There seems the exultation of conscious omnipotence
and universal mastery in the leapings and thunderings
of this hurricane-tossed sea!”</p>

<p>Such thoughts rushed upon Nathan as fiercely as the
tempest itself—as if Satan himself were riding the storm
and dashing them into his face with the spray and foam.</p>

<p>Still he was all ear for what might follow that cry for
help. Clinging to the side of the boat with both hands,
he kept his face set toward where the other boat seemed
to be, and almost stilled his heart-beat as he listened. It
seemed as if his soul had gone to his ears, and was leaning
forth, as men sometimes do from a casement, to catch
the faintest word that might come from the Master in
answer to the despairing cry of his followers. And there
came—a faint ripple of speech, a shadow or ghost of articulate
sound almost lost amid the deafening and majestic
outcries of the storm? No. A wailing prayer for help
to One above the clouds? No. A quavering, hesitating
voice as of one doubtful of himself and of the issue? No.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[182]</a></span>
The voice that came was so clear, so penetrating, so dominant
among the wild noises of the storm, so full of calm
decision and unquestionable authority and sovereign
forces, that one felt sure in advance of what the result
would be.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Peace—be still!</span></p>

<p>No sooner had these words gone forth on the wrestling,
roaring winds than they fell dead in full career. No sooner
had these words gone forth on the wrestling, roaring billows
that went charging against the sky with their crested
battalions than they sank in their places as sinks the ox
when smitten on the forehead by the axe of some mighty
man. And there was a great calm. Hardly a ripple was
left in sea or air. What a sudden silence! In an instant
the demons of the storm had not only taken flight, but
were already beyond hearing and sight. And, looking
up, Nathan and his companions saw that even the clouds
had wholly fled, and left the stars looking down on them
as peacefully as if nothing had happened, or ever would
happen again. And off, a little way, the starlight was
softly shimmering on a summer sea, on gently plashing
oars, on a boat and boatmen, and in the stern on the eminent
form of Him who had now shown himself King of
Nature as well as King of men.</p>

<p>Nathan and his companions reached the shore very
soon after Jesus. They had scarcely landed and joined
him when, from one of the cave-tombs that skirt the shore,
there rushed toward them a figure that seemed scarcely
human. He came as if driven by the tempest that had
just maddened the lake. He was himself a tempest of the
most frightful kind—as appeared when he drew near. He
was quite naked. His face and body were covered with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[183]</a></span>
scars and filth and fresh blood. In his hands he carried
sharp stones, with which he beat and cut himself as he
shrieked and ran. His long hair streamed in the wind
and seemed like a cluster of flying serpents biting at his
brain. And when he came near—ah, what an expression
in those fiery eyes and tormented features! It was as if
hell itself, with all its fiendishness and misery, had been
condensed into that awful face. Nathan had seen not a
few demoniacs before, but never such a specimen as this.
The very recollection made him shudder. The possibility
of such suffering and such wickedness as were pictured in
that face had never before entered his mind.</p>

<p>The man came directly toward Jesus with frantic leaps
and cries, as if to destroy him—as he seemed well able to
do; such were the wonderful activity and strength he displayed.
But Jesus, standing a little in advance of his
disciples, calmly awaited the coming. His face was another
wonder to see. It was sublime—it was divine.
Such unutterable calm, such boundless pity, such inexhaustible
resources of force and authority and sovereignty
spoke in every feature that Nathan could not but say to
himself, <span class="smcap">Lo, God is here</span>.</p>

<p>The monster sank on his knees under the spell of that
divine gaze—uttering a fearful cry as of many voices
crushed into one.</p>

<p>“What is thy name?” said Jesus.</p>

<p>And through the parted but unmoving lips of the
madman, and as if from deep within, came a mystery of
speech that said:</p>

<p>“My name is Legion, for we are many. What have
we to do with thee, thou Son of God most High? Art
thou come hither to torment us before the time? If<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[184]</a></span>
thou cast us out, suffer us to go into yonder herd of
swine.”</p>

<p>Jesus said, <i>Go!</i></p>

<p>Promptly at the word, the crowd of evil spirits that
had captured that body, bound its inhabitant, and seized
the reins of power, fled headlong. Nathan knew it from
the mighty change that at once flashed over the demoniac.
The monster became a man. The face just now terrible
with the lightnings of hellish passions, more terrible than
the storm on the Sea of Galilee or any other sea, suddenly
became a new face—transformed almost beyond recognition
into repose, sanity, sweetness, joy. Nathan was
astonished at the transfiguration. He could not help
crying out, <i>Glory to God!</i> and his heart cried louder
than his lips. He had seen dispossessions before; and
they were delightful things to see. But he had never
before seen a man delivered from an entire synagogue of
devils, from the Nemesis of a whole army of evil spirits.
That was a deliverance past speech. That was an exodus
to bring out the sun in the face of a man.</p>

<p>The man was saved, but the swine were lost. For the
whole herd of about two thousand, just now stolidly feeding
along the steep bank, pricked up their ears, stood
snuffing the air, and then, as if possessed by as many
whirlwinds, rushed headlong down the steep into the lake
and perished. The disciples understood the judgment as
well as the mercy. Those swine, kept contrary to the
law, and serving as a standing defiance of the law
through all that region, were felt to have been justly confiscated.
But the owners were naturally sore at the loss
of their property, and others were afraid of like losses;
and so they persuaded the people of the district to go in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[185]</a></span>
a body to Jesus and beg him to leave. The people did
it—though they saw the man who had been the terror of
the whole country-side sitting at the feet of Jesus, clothed
and in his right mind. Strange infatuation! The people
themselves were possessed. The evil spirits that had
forsaken the man, and forsaken the swine, had entered
into <em>them</em>—as a legion of fools. Jesus did not refuse their
suicidal request. So the two boats immediately returned
to Capernaum.</p>

<p>This ended Nathan’s visit to Jesus. He left the same
day for Egypt—left with stronger faith than ever in Jesus
as the Messiah. The absence of all the usual magical
preparations for his wonders, the exceeding magnitude
and variety of them, the magnificent ease with which
they were performed, the fearless manner in which they
were exposed to the blaze of public observation, the universal
consent to their reality on the part of even his worst
enemies, the plain antagonism of his whole teaching to
the idea that they were of Satanic origin, together with
the sovereign and divine expression that reigned in his
mien while doing them, seemed conclusive. It seemed
impossible for any fair-minded man to look into that face
and watch its expressions without getting the impression
of unutterable genuineness and goodness. He could doubt
neither the reality nor the divine origin of the miracles of
Jesus.</p>

<p>But, somehow, the people at large were not impressed
as he was. They were getting used to the wonderful
works. And the leaders of the people were industriously
encouraging the idea of a Satanic agency in them—and
with growing success. About the Sea of Galilee, where
most of his mighty works are done, Jesus has very few<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[186]</a></span>
who believe in him. He does not conform to the current
notion of what the Messiah should be. He gives no encouragement
to political unrest; he makes no attempt to
form a political party, collects no military stores, gathers
no army, assumes no state. He seems to aim at no worldly
grandeur for himself or nation. He has even been understood
to say that rejection and suffering and even death
await him—that, in short, his kingdom is not of this
world. This is very unsatisfactory to the people at large.
If he would only proclaim a temporal kingdom, set up the
standard of revolt against Rome, and summon the people
to rally about it, no doubt they would rush to him at
once. But as it is, they will go from him. So it seemed
to Nathan as he watched the people; and so it seemed to
him it would be as he read the prophets. The more he
studied them the more inclined was he to think that they
had been misunderstood.</p>

<p>“I think very much as you do,” said Aleph, “and
shall not be at all surprised if Jesus the Messiah should
prove a Sacrifice as well as a king. King he certainly is—king
of devils, king of diseases, king of the elements,
king of teachers——”</p>

<p>Here he was interrupted by the door-keeper, who came
to say that through the eyelet of the door he could see
Antis approaching with what seemed a police force.</p>

<p>“Oh, do not let him enter,” exclaimed Miriam in great
distress; “if he enters I shall die. You do not know all
I know.” And she raised herself in the bed and wrung
her hands in an agony of apprehension.</p>

<p>“Do not disturb yourself,” said Aleph calmly.
“Though we do not know all, we know enough. But
Jesus knew it all, and you have his promise. Trust it and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[187]</a></span>
reserve such strength as you have till it is needed. We
will not desert you.”</p>

<p>A violent blow on the street-door was now heard.</p>

<p>“I will go to the door,” said Aleph, “and if I need
any help you will discover it, as I will leave the passage
open so that you can hear what is passing.”</p>

<p>Taking his cane, he proceeded to the door; and, bidding
the door-keeper undo the fastenings, he suddenly set
the door widely open and stood in its place.</p>

<p>This was unexpected. Antis was just in the act of repeating
his blow on the door, but suddenly finding himself
confronted by a formidable looking man instead of a
door, he stepped hastily backward.</p>

<p>“What do you seek,” demanded Aleph, fixing on the
man a stern eye, “that you knock in so unbecoming a
manner?”</p>

<p>“I seek the possession of my own house,” said the fellow
sullenly.</p>

<p>“Are you the owner of this house? I think you will
hardly venture to claim that.”</p>

<p>“I claim that I have purchased the right of an owner,
so far as occupying this house is concerned, for one month,
and that it is the will of the owner that I have possession
at once.”</p>

<p>“Show me that such is the will of the owner.”</p>

<p>Antis produced a paper and handed it to Aleph.</p>

<p>After reading it, Aleph said, “It seems that this house
belongs to Malus, and that he wishes it transferred to you,
and that he has sent this police force which I see behind
you to enforce his wishes, if necessary.—Are you the captain
of this force?” he added, looking at a man who stood
a few steps behind Antis.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[188]</a></span></p>

<p>“I am,” he said.</p>

<p>“In ordinary cases,” said Aleph slowly, as he surveyed
the man—“in ordinary cases we should be warranted in
putting you in immediate possession; but this case is extraordinary—so
extraordinary that we have a right to presume
that neither Malus nor the chief of the police understood
the circumstances when they gave the order just
shown me.”</p>

<p>“We have no discretion,” said the captain. “We are
sent here to put this man in possession, not to judge of
the righteousness of it.”</p>

<p>“Do you mean to say that if you should see reason to
believe that your force of some six men is quite insufficient
to accomplish your object, you would not be at liberty
to return to your superiors for further instructions?
Are you not expected to use discretion in judging whether
such is the case?”</p>

<p>“Certainly: but such does not appear to be the present
case,” said the officer with a chuckle.</p>

<p>Without noticing the manner of the man, Aleph went
on, “Do you mean to say that if you should see grave
reason to fear that this man in whose behalf you are interfering
would use the house to waylay and murder Malus
and your chief, you would not be warranted in at least
returning for further instructions?”</p>

<p>“Well—in such a case as you suppose, I should of
course return: but this is not such a case, nor anything
like it,” said the man doggedly.</p>

<p>“Very considerably like it: for I shall show you grave
reason to fear that this man” (he pointed his finger at
Antis) “is capable of doing all that and worse—that he
is a desperado of the worst sort, and——”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[189]</a></span></p>

<p>Here Antis broke in, screaming out, “<span class="smcap">It is false! It
is false!</span>”</p>

<p>Aleph fixed on him eyes that blazed calmly into his
for a moment, and then said sternly, “You know it is
<em>true</em>, you ruffian. It is written in your face for everybody
to see. And everybody sees it. If you want to be taken
for anything less than a desperado, wear a mask over your
tell-tale face. So do not interrupt me again;” and he
gave him another look so full of insight and authority
and menace, and at the same time of a certain pitying
wonder (as the man who walks easily finds it hard to
realize that anybody else is lame, so the good man finds it
hard to understand how anybody can be a villain), that he
dropped his eyes, grew pale and red by turns, and made
no further attempt to speak.</p>

<p>Aleph resumed, turning again to the captain: “I was
saying that I would show you grave reason for thinking
this man a desperado of the worst kind; that he is a
robber and murderer by profession; that if put in possession
of this house he will make it a den of thieves and
murderers. He is strongly suspected of designs on the
life of his sick wife, who for some days has been in a critical
condition, and whom he has long abused. It is for
such reasons that her friends have excluded him from the
house. Do you suppose that your principals, if responsibly
informed of these facts, would persist in wishing you
to hand over these premises and the sick woman to such
a man?”</p>

<p>“I admit,” answered the officer, “that if you can show
that he is such a dangerous character, and that putting
him in possession will endanger the public as well as the
sick woman, or even can show that this is so in the opinion<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[190]</a></span>
of responsible parties, I ought to return and report
the fact to my superiors. Who are the persons who make
these charges?”</p>

<p>“His wife, supported by Seti, the Egyptian high-priest,
the lady Rachel, daughter of the Alabarch, and
myself, a member of the University.”</p>

<p>The captain had for some time appeared uneasy. He
now folded his arms, shifted repeatedly from one foot to
another, fumbled aimlessly with the short sword at his
side. Aleph watched him narrowly; and at length said
with a grave irony of tone:</p>

<p>“Perhaps you do not consider Seti and the Alabarch
as responsible parties!”</p>

<p>But immediately changing his tone and raising his
voice, he added, “I call to witness both those before me
in the street and those behind me in the house” (half
turning as he spoke, he became aware that he had already
been followed into the passage by all his friends), “that I
have repeatedly informed this officer that this house has
been occupied by parties whose responsibility it were absurd
to question, for the sole purpose of preventing its becoming
a danger to life and a public nuisance, and that if
he puts it into the possession of this man he will, in their
opinion, imperil the lives and property of the people of
Alexandria. I wish you all to distinctly notice this. Take
notice, also, that we do not propose to resist the law—only
to retain possession till the law can be properly informed
of facts that were unknown to it at the time its
order was given. And so our very moderate request is
that this officer return to headquarters, report what he
has heard, and ask for new instructions. If the officials
then repeat their order, it will be with full knowledge of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[191]</a></span>
the responsibility they are incurring, and they can properly
be held to account for all the consequences: and this
must be a very serious account unless the laws and public
opinion of Alexandria differ very considerably from those
of Heaven.”</p>

<p>“It is he of the Diapleuston!” cried a voice from the
street. “Give him a cheer!”</p>

<p>And a great cheer there was; for though the street
was a retired one, quite a body of spectators had gathered
one by one behind the police and were watching the conference
with lively interest. They now showed audibly
on which side their partialities had settled. That cry, <i>It
is he of the Diapleuston</i>, opened their mouths, and opened
them widely. But, long before they had chosen their side,
Antis made a very sorry appearance over against Aleph;
and as the citizens watched the lofty composure of the
young man and his princely bearing, and caught a glimpse
of Shaphan and Nathan and the womanly star in the background,
they thought the house was well occupied as it
was. And they proceeded to say so. They became very
free in expressing their minds.</p>

<p>One cried out scornfully, “Turning out <em>such</em> to put
in <em>such</em>!”</p>

<p>“Go away!” cried a second, as he shook his fist energetically
at the police.</p>

<p>“Off with you!” shouted a third, with both hands in
the air, and with the air of one driving away a flock of
geese.</p>

<p>“Go!” screamed a fourth, “and you may confidentially
tell those who sent you that you were not mean
enough, as well as not strong enough, to do the work set
you!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[192]</a></span></p>

<p>And so the cries went on in a very amusing (to the
citizens) and significant variety—went on growing in
strength and urgency.</p>

<p>The captain plainly saw that but one course was open
to him. He must make a virtue of necessity, and withdraw
for the present with as good grace as he could. So
he said that perhaps it would be well for him to report at
headquarters what had been told him, and see what his
principals thought of it. Of course, they did not intend
to establish a den of thieves and murderers. So off he
marched with his detachment—Antis closely following
with a face in which fear and mortification and rage were
contending for the mastery, and greeted as he passed with
many a <i>See the hangdog</i> and other like complimentary
expressions.</p>

<p>Aleph bowed to the friendly citizens with a smile, got
another hearty cheer in return, and closed the door.</p>

<p>Shaphan and Nathan were warm in their congratulations.
As for Rachel—her eyes were more lustrous than
ever, and a richer color was in her cheek, but she said
nothing. She did not even look at him.</p>

<p>The two brothers, however, were by no means sure
that Malus would give over his effort. It was not his
way. He made it a point to carry his point on all occasions.
To be sure, the case as Aleph had presented it
seemed wholly true and reasonable; it even seemed unsafe
to Malus personally to proceed; but then he was a man
of many resources, had grown venturesome by the habit
of success. So they were afraid that it was only a brief
respite that had been obtained.</p>

<p>Aleph was inclined to the same view. He had little
doubt but that Malus would recognize his antagonist, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[193]</a></span>
would find in the fact additional motive to persevere. So
he expressed his regret that it was not possible to remove
Miriam at once to some other house.</p>

<p>This brought back Rachel from her abstraction. She
went at once to the bedside of Miriam, who clasped her
hands and looked up piteously into the loving eyes that
beamed inquiringly upon her.</p>

<p>“Do you think that you could bear to be carried home
now?” they asked.</p>

<p>“Right away! right away!” broke out the poor
woman with unexpected strength of voice. “It is better
to die on the way than to stay here. I should die of fear.
Let <em>him</em> not leave me”—and she turned her eyes beseechingly
toward Aleph.</p>

<p>He approached, took her hand gently, and said a few
soothing words while he watched her. She grew quiet
and peaceful as her eyes rested on his face.</p>

<p>“It seems to me,” he at length said, “that she can
better go than stay. She can summon resolution for the
one, but not for the other. The effort may even reinforce
her vitality.”</p>

<p>“Then let it be done,” said Rachel. “My sedan is
large, and I can take her in my arms, and ease all the
motions, and the bearers will move very carefully. Shall
we do it?”—she bent to the ear of the sick woman.</p>

<p>Miriam looked at her gratefully, and said with some
hesitation:</p>

<p>“If <em>he</em> will go.”</p>

<p>“Certainly he will go,” cried Rachel, “and will walk
by the side of the chair, and will steady it with his hand,
and will every now and then look in upon us through the
curtains to see that we are all right; and when we reach<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[194]</a></span>
home he will take you out all carefully and tenderly and
carry you in his strong arms up to your own room and lay
you on your own bed—<em>of course</em> he will. He shall not
have my approbation for what he has done to-day till he
sees us both safe at home”—and the great dewy eyes
flashed half merrily and half timidly on Aleph.</p>

<p>Aleph bowed. “The approbation of the lady Rachel
is very far from being a matter of indifference to me. So
I will do as she says. We will all go—our friends of the
khans, the leech, and all the servants, save the janitor,
who on demand shall put Malus in possession. Do you
approve?”—he had turned toward Shaphan and his
brother.</p>

<p>“We do,” said Shaphan, “but before we go into the
street, I wish to mention a fact which perhaps may concern
you. We saw Malus to-day in close talk with Simon,
the famous magician; and later in the day, on going to
your khan, we found that Simon and the beautiful
Helena, whom he sometimes calls his daughter and sometimes
his sister, had established themselves there and had
placarded the neighborhood with invitations to the public
to come and witness his wonderful performances at a
stater a head. For as much more fee he promises to put
the resources of his art at the service of any visitor;
whether he wishes to have his fortune told, or to consult
spirits, or to prosper in love, or in war, or in money-getting.”</p>

<p>“Have I not heard,” said Rachel anxiously, “that
this magician is an agent of Malus and is suspected of
aiding him in his undertakings by the magical art?”</p>

<p>“As much is said,” answered the Jew. “The two
men are cousins, though not often seen together. It is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">[195]</a></span>
supposed, however, by some that there is much secret
intercourse between them, and that the great success of
Malus in his affairs is largely due to his being in league
with evil spirits. This, of course, he stoutly denies. He
laughs at the idea. At the same time he speaks highly
of his cousin, the sorcerer, and does not a little to give
him patronage.”</p>

<p>“And yet,” said Aleph, “the Law is severe against
sorcerers.”</p>

<p>“But Malus denies that Simon <em>is</em> a sorcerer in the
sense used in our Scriptures. He does not deal with evil
spirits. He is only a man of great skill and learning,
who has studied nature profoundly and so found out
many scientific means of doing many wonderful things,
and even of subjecting the elemental spirits that inhabit
water and fire and lightnings and stars to his will and the
public service. His spirits are not devils. His sorcery is
only science. And God forbid that the Law should denounce
science. So Malus presents the case. The two
men certainly uphold each other and play into each other’s
hands. I wonder what mischief they are brewing now
between them!”</p>

<p>“I thank you for this information,” said Aleph. “It
may prove of service to me. But now let us proceed to
the work before us.”</p>

<p>Under the direction of Rachel, the servants in a few
moments collected the various articles of furniture and
comfort that had been sent from the mansion of Alexander.
She then placed herself in the sedan: and, the
nurse having wrapped Miriam in the bed-coverings, Aleph
carefully took the light burden in his arms and placed it
in the arms of Rachel. As carefully the porters lifted the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[196]</a></span>
chair and made their way into the street—preceded by the
two brothers, accompanied by Aleph, and followed by the
remaining servants. In a few moments the house was in
the solitary charge of the janitor, with instructions to wait
a while and, if no one should appear, to lock the door and
carry the key to the police headquarters for the district.</p>

<p>The escort stopped at the private family entrance.
Here the two brothers took leave; and Aleph, receiving
the sick woman into his arms, followed Rachel into the
mansion, along halls and courts and flights of steps, to
the room the nurse had formerly occupied. When he had
laid his light burden on the bed and had satisfied himself
that she had borne the transfer without serious harm,
though much wearied and needing to be left in profound
quiet, he turned to depart.</p>

<p>The sick woman beckoned feebly to Rachel—more
with her eye than with her hand. The young lady drew
near and bent to listen to the faint whispers.</p>

<p>“She wishes me to thank you for what you have done
for her,” said the maiden after a moment, “and to beg
that you will not forsake her now that she is safe among
friends.”</p>

<p>Aleph looked inquiringly at the lovely interpreter—not
knowing exactly how to interpret the interpretation.</p>

<p>She suddenly turned to Miriam. “Of course he will
not forsake you. He is coming here often to see you—to
see how you get on. No good physician neglects his patient
till she is well; and not even then if he is wise. Besides,
he wants to talk more with you about Jesus the
Messiah as soon as you are able to hear it. Yes, <em>of course</em>
he is coming, coming often, coming to-morrow. He will<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">[197]</a></span>
suffer in our good opinion if he does not. So now close
your eyes and rest in peace.”</p>

<p>Instead of doing this, Miriam burst into a flood of
tears and nervous sobbing. Up to this time she could
not fully realize that the dreadful nightmare of her life
was over. But now that she found herself in her own
room, and looking about on the familiar objects, and recognizing
one thing after another that she used to call hers,
and saw only kind faces beaming upon her—all at once a
sense of absolute safety came surging in upon her like a
mighty billow. Ah, what a relief—Heaven in place of
Hell! Then all the flood-gates of feeling gave way. It
was some time before she could control herself enough to
articulate. But at last the words came—though very
faintly:</p>

<p>“Home at last! Thank God, who has fulfilled the
words of Jesus and sent me the deliverer whom he promised!”</p>

<p>The great sea went down as suddenly as it had risen.
In a few moments the exhausted woman closed her eyes
and was sleeping peacefully.</p>

<p>Aleph and Rachel stood together for a little, watching
the peaceful slumber.</p>

<p>“The experiment seems more successful than I feared,”
said Aleph at length; “I am glad that we made it.”</p>

<p>Her voice trembled a little, and her color came, as she
said, without turning toward him and with downcast eyes,
“And he to whom the success is due, and who is doubtless
the friend whom Jesus promised to Miriam, has now
the express and warm approbation that I promised him,
and which I have found it hard to keep back till now.”</p>

<p>Aleph answered, “Your compensation is large—I fear<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">[198]</a></span>
much too large for doing what to me has been a pleasure
and an education. And yet I cannot decline to accept an
approval which my heart values so highly.”</p>

<p>In parting he extended his hand. She placed her own
within it. He carried the snowy prisoner in grave and
reverent courtesy to his lips. Was she offended?</p>

<h3>IX.<br />
<span class="smaller">THE MAGICIAN.</span></h3>

<p>On his return to the khan, as Aleph entered the
Egyptian quarter, he began to notice the papyrus
placards of which Shaphan had spoken; and, as he advanced,
they became numerous—pasted on walls, booths,
boxes, whatever conspicuous object presented itself.
Had the art of printing been known to Simon, he plainly
would have been a famous advertiser. As it was, he had
made a very liberal use of the scribes of the city. Aleph
stopped to read one immense sheet, beautifully written
on, which a boy was carrying aloft on a pole. This sheet
informed the public that Simon, the greatest magician
and master of occult wisdom in modern times, would exhibit
his wonderful powers this eve at the khan near the
Serapeum at the rate of two drachmas a head. The price
for admission had been put so low in order that the entertainment
might be within reach of all. Let all come.
They would see the greatest show on earth. Whatever
the wizards of Thessaly, the astrologers of Chaldea, the
sybils of Magna Grecia, the soothsayers and diviners of
Etruria, and the sorcerers and necromancers of ancient
Egypt and India could do, he was able to do—and more.
Let all the people come and see. For an extra didrachma<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">[202]</a></span>
there would be seats reserved. Seats or no seats, the people
were sure to get more than their money’s worth. If any
wanted their fortunes told by the stars; if they wanted
to know the critical times in their lives so that they
might be on their guard; if they wanted to know what
would be the best times for any undertakings they have
in mind, or to have such helps in them as the elemental
spirits can give, or to compound love potions, or to communicate
with distant and even dead friends, or to defend
themselves from enemies—in short, whoever wanted help
of any kind that he could not get by the common and
natural means, now was the opportunity of a life-time;
let him come to Simon, the great magician of the age.
He will not be disappointed. Admission to the court of
the khan one didrachma—seats under the piazza two didrachmas.</p>

<p>Cimon was found waiting just outside the khan;
from the inside of which came the sound of busy axes
and hammers. He proposed that they should go for their
evening meal to some quiet stall in the neighboring
Egyptian market and there talk over their concerns. Accordingly,
they were soon established in a nook by themselves,
and Aleph proceeded to relate his experiences during
the day thus far.</p>

<p>In return, Cimon said that the object of Seti in calling
him aside was to ask whether he had as yet seen any
sign of a hostile movement on the part of the son of the
Governor; also whether he knew of any reason why
Malus would favor such a movement. The first question
he answered in the negative: as to the second, he was
obliged to say that there were circumstances that made
it likely that Malus would favor any scheme to their disadvantage<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">[203]</a></span>
of which he might happen to learn. On this,
Seti said that, knowing well as he did the violent and revengeful
character of the young Roman, he had thought
it best to have his movements watched; and had discovered
that, since the disturbance at the Diapleuston, and
especially within the last twenty-four hours, there had
been considerable stealthy intercourse between him and
Malus. It looked very much as if they were concerting
mischief. After what Cimon had told him he had no
doubt as to the objects of the mischief. Might he ask
whether the circumstances referred to were such as to enlist
Malus thoroughly in any enterprise, however bad,
against himself and his young friend? To this Cimon
had answered that the circumstances were indeed such
that their entire disappearance from the scene would free
Malus from a great peril.</p>

<p>“Then,” said Seti emphatically, “he will join the
Roman in trying to do you all the mischief he can. He
will have no scruple as to way or means.”</p>

<p>After Aleph and Rachel had left, Seti had still detained
him for a while with various examples of the unscrupulous
craft and daring of the man—so plainly for
the purpose of putting them on their guard against him
that he was almost on the point of explaining their relations
to Malus in full; especially after Seti had concluded
with asking that for the sake of greater security
they would exchange their present quarters for rooms in
the Serapeum. “It was an unusual thing to do, not to
say unprecedented; but the circumstances were unusual.”
So he begged that they would transfer themselves
without delay. But Cimon thought that he ought
to confer with Aleph about the matter before accepting<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">[204]</a></span>
the offer. So, thanking the priest for it, and promising
to report the next day, he took leave.</p>

<p>“Would it not have been well,” said Aleph, “to
leave in the hands of the high-priest that parcel which I
saw you making up last evening of the results of your inquiries
as to Malus—I mean for safe keeping?”</p>

<p>“That is what I did,” replied the Greek; “going
back for that purpose after I had made another visit and
added to the parcel some account of that.”</p>

<p>He then proceeded to say that, finding it still so early
that he might hope to find the custom house superintendent
at his post, he determined to call upon him and ascertain
the result of the inquiry he had promised to
make. This he did. The official reported that the eminent
merchant Malus had entered the office shortly after
Cimon had left it, and, on hearing of the request to examine
the registers, had kindly offered to solicit a permit
from the Governor. It would be very little trouble, as he
was about going to Bruchium on business of his own.
But he proved unsuccessful. Despite his efforts, the
most he could obtain was a permit for <em>himself</em> to make
the examination in behalf of the stranger; and then only
in case the person should approve himself to him as a
person of standing and consideration. Of course this
ended the matter. Cimon bowed and retired.</p>

<p>He was not disappointed. From the moment when
he met Malus in the passage he had not counted on any
other issue; though without any idea of the ingenious
way in which it would be brought about.</p>

<p>“How much will this failure be likely to embarrass
our cause?” inquired Aleph.</p>

<p>“It makes it impossible for us to charge Malus with a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">[205]</a></span>
crime against the State; that is, the crime of smuggling,
or of collusion with some custom house officials to defraud
the government.”</p>

<p>“I understand. You have certified copies of the receipts
at Myos Hermos; also certified copies of the receipts
given for the same goods by Malus as harbor-master
here; so that you know that Malus has received all
the goods sent. If any of these do not appear on the
registers here, it must be because he has brought them
into the city without passing them through the custom
house, or, if through the custom house, is in conspiracy
with some of its officials to defraud the State—a crime
more likely to get prompt attention than one that is
merely against an individual—and a foreigner.”</p>

<p>“Exactly. Still our case, as it now stands, would
naturally compel a formal examination of the registers:
for we can prove that Malus has received everything up
to the gates of the custom house. Beyond the gates he
declares himself to have received much less—that is,
much has been lost in passing through the custom house.
This is really charging its officials with crime. Such a
charge, it would seem, must compel an examination of
the registers. Still I would have been glad to set the offense
against the State in the foreground of the battle.”</p>

<p>“Then,” said Aleph, “supposing the registry accounts
to agree with ours, Malus would be liable to refund
the value of the missing goods according to the
prices ruling at the times they were received, and to add
to this a considerable sum on nearly every one of the
many other lots consigned to him for thirty years on account
of false statements as to the duties imposed and
the prices current—in regard to both of which you have<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">[206]</a></span>
gained sufficient information. Have you estimated what
the whole indebtedness amounts to?”</p>

<p>“Not closely; but it must amount to an immense
sum. And then, if Malus should incidentally be convicted
of smuggling, half of the large sum forfeited by
the Roman law would fall to the party establishing the
fact. If the courts are equitable our success means the
ruin of Malus (or what he would consider such)—especially
as it would bring upon him the claims of many
other persons whom he has wronged, but who hitherto
have been afraid to contend with him. Of course a man
with so much at stake must be expected to make great
efforts to secure himself; and such a man as Malus will
stop at nothing, however criminal, that promises to help
him. By this time, no doubt, he is wide awake.”</p>

<p>“Do you suppose,” inquired Aleph after a moment’s
silence, “that the exhibition this evening is inspired by
him and covers some designs against us?”</p>

<p>“I fear so,” said Cimon, moving uneasily, “though
I do not see clearly how it can be made to serve his purpose.
I would that we and our belongings were well in
the Serapeum. But it is now too late in the day to
make a change: all that we can do is to be wary while remaining
for the night at the khan.”</p>

<p>“I should have some scruples about being present at
a professedly magical exhibition if it were not practically
involuntary. But, since we have no choice in the matter,
we may at least get the advantage of noticing the
contrast between the miracles of Jesus as they have been
reported to us and the marvels of the most famous magician
of our time—for such I understand he is considered.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">[207]</a></span></p>

<p>“Try to imagine some advantage to his cousin Malus
in this movement,” suggested Cimon.</p>

<p>“Is it not supposable that Malus is very superstitious
(as I believe such men are apt to be) and has great confidence
in the magic art, and hopes to weave about us
some hindering if not destructive spell, enlisting against
us demoniacal forces? Perhaps, too, he proposes to
frighten us from our purpose by astrological and other
predictions of impending evil: also will seek to enlarge
his knowledge of us by asking for the facts needed for
constructing a horoscope.”</p>

<p>“That will do very well for a guess,” said Cimon.
“And since we are guessing I will make a small contribution.
Perhaps the darkness which is sure to accompany
the exhibition at some stage will be used for an attack
on us bodily. This can be imputed to spirits. If I
should see among the spectators any persons with villainous
and cut-throat faces, I should feel called on to be on
the watch.”</p>

<p>During this conversation their simple meal had been
brought and dispatched (not without an audible thanksgiving);
and Cimon now proposed that they should at
once return to the khan and acquaint themselves with
their new surroundings somewhat in advance of the evening’s
performance.</p>

<p>The sun was about setting, and many people were already
collected about the gate, reading the large poster
that hung upon it and comparing views and expectations,
when our friends came up. They were at once admitted
as being guests of the establishment.</p>

<p>They found a platform erected in the middle of the
court, and closely drawn about by curtains on which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">[208]</a></span>
were various cabalistic characters. From within issued a
smoke, an odor as of strange drugs, a hissing sound as of
boiling, faint flashes of light, and various sounds as of
people moving about and arranging. Around the stage,
at a small distance, hurdles had been set up—also about
the piazza. The only break in these two lines of hurdles
was opposite the room which Cimon and Aleph occupied.
Here were two gates giving access from the
stage to the piazza by means of a flight of steps from the
former.</p>

<p>“What does this mean?” thought our two friends.
“Did it <em>happen</em> so?”</p>

<p>In passing to their room along the piazza they found
benches, each of which could seat four persons, standing
before each room, but set forward so as to allow free passage
behind them. Before their own door, however,
stood only a single short bench seating only two persons.
Right before this seat, under the eaves of the piazza,
hung a single lighted lamp—the only lamp visible anywhere.</p>

<p>“And what does all this mean?” thought our friends.
“Does it mean honor to us as the guests of the house or
to make us easier marks for the archer?”</p>

<p>Without stopping to answer such questions they unlocked
their door; and, entering, held their usual evening
devotions with no appearance of distraction or hurry.
When they came out, staff in hand, and took seats on the
bench before the door, they found that the shadows had
considerably deepened, and the signs of activity within
the curtained stage had considerably increased. As yet
no spectators had been admitted.</p>

<p>Soon, however, people began to enter the court:<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">[209]</a></span>
then, after a while, the piazza began to be occupied.
Our friends watched narrowly every successive arrival as
long as the deepening shadows allowed; but it soon became
impossible to form any idea of faces and figures.
But they were very many—so many at last that there
seemed to be no more standing room in the court, nor
sitting room under the piazza. The seats nearest them,
on the right and left, somehow came to be occupied last,
and though Aleph bent specially on them his young
searching eyes, the light had become too dim to be of service.
He then noticed for the first time that the lamp
before him had protruding sides that fended off the rays
to the right and left. Himself and companion would
have the sole benefit of the illumination. Would it be a
benefit?</p>

<p>A bell tinkled. Up went the stage curtains. In the
midst of a blaze of light stood a man of unusual stature.
His beard was long and black, and long black locks hung
below the close-fitting black cap. A long black mantle
covered with geometrical and other figures hung gracefully
from his shoulders. Supreme confidence in his
own powers and position breathed in his whole attitude
and expression. His air was that of an acknowledged
sage. He stood motionless for a few moments as if to allow
the people a full opportunity to see what a dignified
and promising person was before them. He then turned
quietly and took a cool survey of the packed court and of
the piazza beyond as if to acquaint himself with the situation—to
see how many persons and what sort of persons
made up his audience. His survey ended with his
confronting Cimon and Aleph for a moment.</p>

<p>A little back of this remarkable figure stood another<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">[210]</a></span>
scarcely less noticeable—a beautiful woman richly,
though scantily, dressed, in the Greek fashion. Behind
her, at the two corners of the platform, stood two Nubians,
black as midnight, who could scarcely be said to
be dressed at all. Between these latter stood a table on
which was a seething cauldron over a brazier of live coals—also
a large shallow dish. Two stools and a number of
tools were under the table.</p>

<p>Simon turned and bowed low to Helena—for that was
the Aspasia-like woman near him. Then, turning to the
people:</p>

<p>“I always make it a point,” said he, “to begin with
acknowledging my obligations to my sister, to whom I am
indebted for much of my success.”</p>

<p>He then added, “I wish it to be distinctly understood
at the outset that a part of what I shall do this evening
is only skillful illusion; another part will be done simply
by means of my acquaintance with the more mysterious
laws and forces of Nature; a third part will be done by
the help of powerful spirits whom I have subjected, to a
certain extent, by my art, but who do not belong to that
class of spirits with whom intercourse is forbidden.”</p>

<p>He at once began to draw a ribbon from his mouth.
He drew and drew—apparently there was no end to the
stock of ribbons within him. At last, with a gesture of
impatience, he broke off the endless thing at his lips,
and gulped down the remainder. He then went to the
brazier of glowing coals and proceeded to eat them as so
much fruit—to eat with excellent appetite.</p>

<p>Suddenly turning from this feast, he took up the
large dish on the table and poured out from it a quantity
of sand on the platform. He completely reversed the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">[211]</a></span>
dish and shook it. He then replaced the sand, inserted
in it a small seed, spread his two hands over the dish, and
waited for what might happen. What happened was a
little olive tree—as everybody could see as soon as Simon
had removed his hands and held up the dish for general
view. He then set down the dish on the floor, covered it
for a moment with a corner of his mantle, and then held
it up to view again. Lo, the little olive of a few inches
had doubled its size. Once more he covered it from view.
On removing his robe, he showed to the people a plant
so large that its roots had crowded out all the sand from
the vessel and protruded from it on all sides. Using another
corner of the mantle, he reversed the process. The
great plant dwindled by successive stages into the original
seed which was held up for the people to see.</p>

<p>Taking the same dish, shaking the sand out of it,
even taking the pains to wipe it vigorously with one corner
of his robe, he reversed it on the floor. Muttering a
few words over it, he lifted it and a cat appeared. He
replaced the dish over the cat; after a moment lifted
again, and behold, a dog instead of a cat. Replacing the
dish over the dog, and after a moment lifting it again,
he astonished the people with the sight of a litter of puppies.
Reversing the process, he produced in succession
the dog, the cat, and the empty dish.</p>

<p>He concluded this part of the entertainment by
drawing a sword from under his mantle and swallowing
it.</p>

<p>Next, Simon seated himself at the table, and laid the
tips of his fingers upon it. Helena set a seat by his side
and did the same. The two Nubians came forward, and,
having removed the brazier, seated themselves on the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">[212]</a></span>
table itself. In a few moments it began to tip, and finally
fell to swaying and leaping so violently that the blacks
were unable to keep their seats, though they struggled
hard to do so. Having dislodged the two bulky fellows,
the table rose several feet into the air and remained suspended;
and the brazier with its cauldron rose gently
after it and resumed its old place without any disturbance
of their contents—and all the while raps and musical
sounds both over and under the table were heard. The
Nubians caught hold of the legs of the table and tried
with all their might to pull it down; whereupon it rose
still higher, dragging the men after it. Simon made a
downward pass with his hand, and at once it descended
gently and noiselessly to the floor.</p>

<p>Again Helena seated herself. Simon approached,
took hold of both her hands, and looked steadily into her
eyes. Shortly, relinquishing her hands, he made passes
downward along her arms. Gradually her eyelids drew
together and she slept.</p>

<p>“Now tell us what you see,” said Simon.</p>

<p>“I see,” said she, slowly, and as if looking afar, “a
beautiful country of mountains and green valleys and
crystal streams, sprinkled with flocks and herds and
white-faced keepers.”</p>

<p>“Look again. What do you see now?” continued
the magician.</p>

<p>“I see,” replied Helena, “a magnificent palace
perched on an eminence. It is of stone; and it has
around it walls and towers; and into its court-yard is
now coming a caravan dusty and wayworn—loaded horses
and mules and camels; and, escorting them, many armed
horsemen before and behind.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">[213]</a></span></p>

<p>“Enter the palace. What see you now?” continued
the soothsayer.</p>

<p>“I see steps of marble, doors of brass, a lofty hall
with sculptures and suits of armor, sumptuous apartments
after apartments—a library in which are four persons;
two sitting on a couch, and two standing before
them. The first two are a man and woman venerable
with white locks, but with no other signs of great age:
the other two, also a man and woman, are much younger
and still in the fullness of mature life. All are of
princely features and bearing.”</p>

<p>“What are they doing?” demanded Simon.</p>

<p>“The younger couple are untying tablets bound about
with a black ribbon. They are now reading—plainly
with surprise and grief.”</p>

<p>“Approach and read with them,” said Simon.</p>

<p>“I cannot read. The characters are strange. Besides,
tears have fallen copiously on them,” said the
woman.</p>

<p>Simon reversed his passes, and the woman, giving a
great sigh, opened her eyes.</p>

<p>He then came forward to the edge of the stage next
to our friends.</p>

<p>“We come now,” said he, “to something very important.
It has been known from remotest times that it
is possible to determine from the stars the general character
of a man’s fortunes, the critical times in his life,
the sort of dangers to which he will be most exposed.
Becoming acquainted with these, he can take precautions
accordingly. For example, if one finds that to-morrow
will be a time of special peril to him, and that the peril
will come from a city, he can leave the city at once and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">[214]</a></span>
so secure himself. So it is very important that each one
of you inform himself in advance all about these critical
and dangerous times that are sure to come to him. Do
not neglect this opportunity of consulting the stars. It
is the opportunity of a life-time. For the very small
consideration of only one gold stater he can have the
benefit of my profound studies among the stars, studies
which I can assure you have been profounder and more
successful than those of any other man, not excepting
Hermes Trismegistus himself. All you have to do is to
hand me the piece of gold, together with the exact time
and place of your birth, and I will construct the twelve
Heavenly Houses, and find the places of the planets
therein, and take account of their mutual bearings and
modifications, and so make out for you a horoscope that
will tell you just what is to be done in every trying situation
as long as you live. And you will live twice as long
for it. Now, who will, at the trifling expense I have
mentioned, protect himself from great harm and secure
to himself wonderful advantages?”</p>

<p>He folded his arms and waited. But no one responded.
Either there was not sufficient faith in the
people, or they had already invested in horoscopes, or the
gold piece required was wanting. The astrologer expressed
surprise at this backwardness to seize the splendid
opportunity they were having for having their fortunes
told by the truth-telling stars through their most
illustrious interpreter. It was a great mistake. They
would surely regret it. He was only passing through the
city on his way to Rome at the invitation of the Emperor
Tiberius, and when he should return, if ever, it was impossible
to say. What was the difficulty? Was it the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">[215]</a></span>
ready money demanded? Well, he would make it easy
for poor people. They might pay him on delivery of the
horoscope and its interpretation. Let them hand in their
names and the facts called for, and he would trust them.</p>

<p>This brought out the people in the court. Not a few
signified their readiness to accept the new offer; and the
Nubians, passing along the inner hurdles with papyrus
and stylus, soon collected quite a catalogue of names and
appropriate particulars. This seemed very satisfactory
to Simon.</p>

<p>He then looked off toward the piazza from whose seats
no response to his appeal had yet come. He was now
ready to attend to them. It was kind in them to wait
till the less favored class had been cared for. Now let
the piazza speak. Though they did not belong to the
impecunious class, he would make no distinction between
the rich and poor, but would serve all on the same terms.
And he walked about the edge of the platform on all
sides with one hand behind his ear.</p>

<p>“Your voices are too feeble,” he at length exclaimed;
“I must get nearer,” and he descended from
the stage by the flight of steps in front of Cimon and
Aleph, opened the wicket and stepped on the piazza.</p>

<p>“Perhaps these friends, one of whom seems to me to
have come from the native land of astrology and may
therefore be presumed to know how potent in human affairs
the stars are, will allow me to construct figures for
them. Somehow I feel a presentiment as I stand near
this young man (and I have never known such presentiments
deceive me), that he is entering a critical period in
his fortunes, and will need all the light my art can throw
on the character of the perils surrounding him and the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">[216]</a></span>
way of escape. If he will tell me the exact date and place
of his birth, I can in a few moments, by means of a great
improvement on old methods, make for him a planetary
construction that will cover the next few days and be of
immense service to him. I trust he believes in the Chaldean
science?”</p>

<p>“At present I express neither assent nor dissent,”
said Aleph; “I only say that I have no occasion for your
art. If perils come I propose to seek help, not from the
stars, but from beyond them.”</p>

<p>This was said in so decisive a tone as to forbid further
solicitation.</p>

<p>Simon merely added in a voice which plainly betrayed
resentment, “Perhaps the young man is aware that the
stars are apt to be hostile to those who distinctly refuse
them. I foresee that they will be hostile to him.” And,
swaying his long loose mantle against the knees of Aleph
as he turned, he stalked back to his place on the platform.</p>

<p>There, folding his arms and looking upward intently
as if carefully perusing the sky at different points, he remained
silent for a while. He then suddenly exclaimed
in a voice of thunder, “Oh, the angry aspects! Oh, the
threatening configurations! Oh, the malignant Saturn
in Aries shooting his rays aslant yonder!”—and he
pointed his finger toward the part of the piazza which he
had just left. He then turned to the people and said
with a voice that seemed oppressed by some mighty burden,
“You have just heard me say that sometimes when
I am very near a person, and especially if my robe touches
him, there comes upon me a presentiment in regard to
him which is, in a measure, a substitute for a horoscope—especially<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">[217]</a></span>
if at once followed by such a consultation of
the heavens as I have just now given.”</p>

<p>“Tell us what you have discovered,” cried a voice
from the court.</p>

<p>“I see,” he cried, “his enterprise miscarrying, his
friends forsaking him, his enemies surrounding him.
Flight alone will save him. And let him not linger.
The black cloud has settled till it touches him—let him
rush from under it. The walls of the house have crept
together till they press him on every side—let him leap
forth before it is too late. The walls of the city have
crowded in upon him till the four gates almost meet one
another—let him struggle through this or that as best he
can, and flee, <em>flee</em>. Flee on the swift Bactrian dromedary,
flee on the swift galley with sails and oars, flee as
does the ostrich before the Arabian with both feet and
wings, flee as do the sands of the desert before the hot
Simoom. Else the Chaldean home will wail for the son
that never returns.”</p>

<p>This he said with the air of a prophet—his tall form
strained to the utmost, his hands lifted, and his voice urgent
and full of horror. He retained his tragic attitude
and aspect for a little after he had ceased speaking.
Meanwhile Helena had stolen up to him, and stood looking
skyward as if trying to see what he saw. Suddenly
he grasped her arm with one hand and with the other
pointed with anxious look toward various parts of the
sky: all the while speaking to her in a low voice, as if
explaining what they saw. He had an apt scholar. She
gave frequent nods of assent, and finally clasped and
wrung her hands with as dismayed an air as his own.</p>

<p>All this seemed to profoundly impress the people in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">[218]</a></span>
the court, on whose upturned faces the many lights of the
stage were strongly shining. They gazed at the astrologer
with open mouths: they seemed awe-struck at his
fiery words and majestic bearing. He glanced from there
to Aleph—was it to see whether the same effect had been
produced on him? At all events he saw none. A perfect
composure reigned in the face and attitude of the
young man. Simon was both disconcerted and angry—as
was plain enough to the sharp young eyes that never
left him.</p>

<p>“I have no doubt,” cried he, after an evident effort
to recover himself, “that nearly all my friends under the
piazza are more respectful to the Celestial Science than
the one whose danger and misfortunes have just been revealed
to me. But, as time presses, I will not ask them
to apply for horoscopes to-night. Let them come to me
as privately as they choose at my rooms here for the next
few days; and it will be strange as well as pitiful if the
book of the stars does not read more pleasantly for them
than it has done for one this evening.”</p>

<p>He made a sign to the Nubians. They hastened to
fan the coals in the brazier; and, when the cauldron had
begun to seethe again, he approached and dropped in
something that made the contents hiss and leap as if they
would burst away from the vessel. He then drew from
under his mantle a sheet of papyrus covered with writing,
dipped the manuscript into the cauldron, lighted it at the
coals, waved it toward the four points till it was wholly
consumed.</p>

<p>He made another sign to Helena. She went to one of
the looped-up curtains and drew from a fold in it with an
air of profound reverence—a wand. This, with averted<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">[219]</a></span>
eyes, she brought to Simon: then sank on her knees and
covered her eyes with her hand. Whereupon the blacks
came up hastily and crouched behind her with all the
signs of abject fear. Dipping the end of the wand in the
cauldron, the magician proceeded to describe with it a
large circle about them all. Dipping again, he traced
just within the circle and all around it a variety of characters—allowing
no break, however small, in the continuity
of the tracing. The lines became gradually luminous—first
the circumference of the circle, then the
endless chain of mystic characters within.</p>

<p>“The Ephesian Letters,” whispered Cimon to Aleph.</p>

<p>There was an intense hush of fearful expectation.</p>

<p>“I am now about,” the magician cried in his gravest
tones, “to summon here mighty genii and elemental
spirits, both to show you the resources of my art, and to
convince as many of you as need convincing (and the
number of such persons is not small in these days) of the
reality of a world of invisible beings possessing great
powers. Many of these spirits are exceedingly mischievous
as well as mighty, and would be glad to destroy us
all. But they dare not cross this circle, and especially
the characters traced just within it—though they would
do so if they could find the least break in the lines. I am
also able to protect those of you without this circle—provided
certain conditions are complied with. All seats
under the piazza must be set forward from the wall so as
to allow free passage behind them for the spirits: and in
addition every one must remain quietly in his place,
whatever may happen or seem to be happening, till I dismiss
you. To all complying with these conditions and
keeping a reverent attitude of mind toward the spirits, I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">[220]</a></span>
can promise entire safety. To others I can promise nothing.
Solomon himself could promise nothing. I wish
all of you to distinctly understand that I will not be responsible
for even the lives of any who violate these conditions.
I warn you that we are about to deal with very
dangerous beings, and that I can only control them under
certain provisos. If any man is disposed to defy
these let him look to himself.”</p>

<p>Both Cimon and Aleph had for some time noticed that
the single lighted lamp that hung just before them was
getting dimmer; and so were not surprised when it flickered
and expired while the magician was speaking.</p>

<p>The man was now looking at his best. He seemed to
have reserved himself for this time. His commanding
stature, his powerful and oracular face, and his stately
bearing enriched by the mysterious and becoming robes
of his art, shone out very impressively under the brilliant
lights of the stage. He stood in the centre of his magical
circle, with his wand in his hand. He cast the wand
on the floor. Lo, a serpent, gliding along with erect and
hissing head till it came to the luminous belt of Ephesian
Letters! There it stopped; and then moved along the
belt slowly, without touching it, as if looking for some
break in it, till it reached the point whence it started.
Then with depressed head it moved back silently to Simon,
who took it by the tail, and lo, he had again a wand
in his hand.</p>

<p>He extended it toward the East and called out with a
great voice in that direction certain uncouth names, saying:</p>

<p>“Genii, spirits elemental of air, of fire, of earth, and
of water! By the bond between us, by this wand which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">[221]</a></span>
ye know, by the spells I have woven, by this magic circle
in which I stand, I summon you, <em>I summon you</em>!”</p>

<p>He then turned toward the other cardinal points, repeating
to each the same formula, though appealing to
different personal names. At once there fell on the ear
the faint beat of distant wings. Shadows began to flit
through the air, and monstrous shapes vaguely showed
themselves on the walls and roofs of the khan. Then
the lights on the stage burned blue, grew feeble, flickered,
went out. Everything was now in profound darkness—save
that on the stage the circumference of the
circle with its inlying border of mystic characters was become
a glowing belt that cast a wierd light on the magician
and his cowering companions, but seemed to have no
power of illuminating beyond the stage. Now the beat
of wings was heard more distinctly. It grew apace.
Soon it was like the rush of winds—high in the air above
the stage, and at various points in the passage left behind
the seats under the piazza. There it swept along with
terrific force—whistling and howling. Into these noises
others immediately insinuated themselves. Strange
whisperings and mutterings became audible. These gradually
passed into raps, detonations, groans, shrieks; and
occasionally a yell so fierce and demoniacal as to be appalling,
rent the air and the ear.</p>

<p>But the chief place of commotion was the edge of the
platform, just outside of the fiery zone. Here, all the
noises that were scattered elsewhere were condensed and
intensified into the roar of a tempest. To fiendish
laughs and screeches and yells that made the ear tingle
were added the bayings of many sorts of wild beasts when
hot after their prey. It seemed as if the spirits were<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">[222]</a></span>
crowding to get at the magician, and tear him limb from
limb, and were chafed to madness on being prevented by
the magic circle. It was the many-voiced sea, lashed into
fury, leaping in spray and thunder on a rock-bound coast.
What a carnival! Was hell emptied? And through the
blackness and the uproar and the fury, pierced voices
like swords—voices that cried:</p>

<p>“We are here, great Master, to do thy bidding. Lo,
we are here!”</p>

<p>At no time during the evening had Cimon, or even
Aleph with his younger eyes, been able to see who occupied
the adjoining seats on their right and left. These
seats had not been taken till it had become too dark to
distinguish faces or even figures: and the single lamp before
themselves was so ensconced among the ornaments
of the eaves of the piazza that it threw no light to either
side. But from both sides they occasionally caught low
sounds of movements and voices; and knew very well that
they had neighbors. And they felt quite sure that if an
attack should be made upon them it would come from
those nearest to them. So, as soon as the lights had all
gone out, after a moment’s whispered conference together,
they noiselessly set their seat back against the
door of their room, and as noiselessly took stand in front
of it and facing it, but at a distance from it of several
feet—and waited for what might happen.</p>

<p>At the height of the uproar and darkness, their ears
caught a stealthy movement at both right and left; and
then the careful footfall of unsandalled feet. A moment
more, and there was a stumbling against the seat they had
left, as of men who had been expecting a clear passage;
while they felt the presence of others just before them.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">[223]</a></span>
At once came a hasty succession of heavy blows, as of
bludgeons, on the seat and door behind it. Two heavy
thuds promptly followed, and as many groans and falls:
for both Cimon and Aleph had struck with clenched
hands into the dark, and had encountered something
more substantial than spirits. This done, they stepped
back to their former places and waited for what might
yet follow. Nothing followed—save the sound of footsteps
hastily retreating to the right and left. And, all at
once, the hubbub of wierd noises began to lull; the whispers
and howls and other diabolic sounds dwindled rapidly;
in a few moments the rush of departing wings had
died away in the distance.</p>

<p>“Now go in peace,” cried the magician. “If any
have been injured by the Powers I have summoned, it is
because they did not obey my directions. Their blood be
on their own heads. I take you to witness that I am not
responsible.”</p>

<p>The court and piazza were soon emptied. The people
had been too soundly frightened to stand on the order of
their going; and rushed out pell-mell through the darkness—overturning
benches and hurdles and one another.</p>

<p>During this final uproar, which was almost as great as
the spirits had made, Aleph felt a hand on his shoulder,
heard a whisper at his ear—“Shaphan and Nathan.”</p>

<p>“Welcome,” he whispered back. “Come into our
room.”</p>

<p>They removed the seat, unlocked the door, and with
the aid of the two Jews dragged inside the bodies which
their feet had encountered on the floor. Closing the
door, they struck a light and proceeded to examine their
still insensible assailants. In one of them Aleph had no<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">[224]</a></span>
difficulty in recognizing Antis: in the other Shaphan and
his brother knew Draco, a noted bully of the city, at
present teacher of fence at the Museum, formerly a
trainer of gladiators at Rome, and well known as a dissipated
companion of the son of the Governor. Having
satisfied themselves that the men were not seriously injured,
and needed only the open air to fully recover, they
drew them out again on the piazza and there left them to
themselves—or their friends.</p>

<p>The brothers then explained that the lady Rachel had
sent a servant to them after their return home to recall
them; and had begged that they would be present at the
khan in the evening with some of the family servants and
give aid to her friends if they should have need. But
various circumstances had delayed them so that they did
not arrive till after the performance had begun; when
they found no admission to the piazza, and the court so
densely packed that it was almost impossible to wedge
their way to the neighborhood of Aleph and Cimon.
This, however, in the course of the evening they had, by
dint of constant effort, succeeded in doing, and were quite
near when the assault was made and the assembly broke
up. They then dashed violently through the crowd, and
over the hurdles—fearing the worst, for they had heard
the blows, the groans, and the heavy falls. Thank
Heaven, it was the enemy that fell!</p>

<p>Very cordial acknowledgments were made to the
friendly Jews. In addition, Aleph sat down and wrote
on a piece of papyrus the following:</p>

<p>“Aleph the Chaldean, to the daughter of Alexander,

<p>“This is to express my sense of the kindness you have<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">[225]</a></span>
shown to the eastern strangers in sending help to them
this night in their supposed danger. And truly the danger
was considerable; but through the favor of the Most
High we have escaped the assault made upon us, and have
come to understand better than before the difference between
the marvels of Jesus and the marvels of the magician.
The latter are due partly to illusion and ventriloquism,
partly to occult natural law, and partly to diabolism.
They are favored by darkness and distance, depend
on preparations and compacts and machinery, proceed
from an unworthy person, seek unworthy objects, are
aided by unworthy Powers, are connected with phenomena
that betray a diabolic origin, and are wholly
depraving and mischievous in their tendency.</p>

<p>“When the bearers of this give you an account of what
they have seen and heard, you will, I doubt not, see new
reason to believe in Him who casts out devils instead of
invoking them.</p>

<p>“May the God of Abraham and Daniel, the Chaldeans,
keep you!</p>

<p>“Farewell!”</p>

<p>When the Jews stepped out on the piazza they found
that the bodies were no longer there. Doubtless they
had recovered consciousness and taken themselves off.</p>

<p>Magic and miracle! Two very different things,
thought Aleph again, as he recalled, in the solitude to
which he was now left, the account which Nathan had
given of the storm on the Sea of Galilee.</p>

<h3>X.<br />
<span class="smaller">THE ARENA.</span></h3>

<p>An evening of such experiences as we have just described
would be followed by a sleepless night in
the case of most persons at the present day. But those
were adventurous times; the element of uncertainty and
peril entered into them far more largely than it does into
our daily life; and the habit of coolly accepting the situation
and accommodating themselves to it was common
among men of standing and courage. So the reader must
not be surprised to learn that our friends, after thanking
Heaven for their preservation, slept about as soundly
through the night as if they had suffered no narrow escape
and were anticipating nothing but safety on the morrow.</p>

<p>Their morning devotions and meal had been finished,
and they were conferring as to Seti’s proposal that they
should remove to the Serapeum, when a knock was heard
on their door, and the high priest himself made his appearance.</p>

<p>“What means all this?” he exclaimed, as he closed
the door behind him and took the rude stool which was
all that Aleph had to offer him; “the whole khan behind
time, everything in a litter, the staging in the court in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">[230]</a></span>
the last stages of a debauch; above all the clubs before
your door and the battered state of the door itself, to say
nothing of the broken seat before it!”</p>

<p>Cimon explained.</p>

<p>“Now you see why I am here so early this morning,”
resumed the priest. “My thoughts were so full of apprehension
on your account during the night that I could
not sleep; and I determined that as soon as possible in
the morning I would seek you out and again urge you to
remove at once to the Serapeum. This evidently is no
place for you. It is plain that Malus and the son of the
governor have gotten into communication with each
other and have joined their forces—plain that the chief
object of the doings here last night was a three-fold assault
on you through your fears, through magical powers,
and through human assassins. These were the three
strings to their bow. They hoped that if the others
failed the clubs of Draco and his helpers would do the
work and the magical powers which you defied take all
the blame of it. You see with what characters you have
to deal. Behold a fair sample of what these men are capable
of doing. So come to the Serapeum without delay.”</p>

<p>“We were speaking of your kind offer just as you
came in,” said Cimon, “and were debating whether we
could properly accept it; and had about come to the conclusion
that we could not do so without dragging the
only friends we have in Alexandria into trouble with
powerful people—which would be a poor return for the
kindness we have received.”</p>

<p>“Leave me to judge,” returned Seti coolly, “as to
the amount of trouble I can afford to be at for your sake.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">[231]</a></span>
The offer I make is made freely in view of the circumstances.”</p>

<p>“We have been afraid,” said Aleph, “that your view
of the circumstances is not as complete as it should be before
we allow your generous kindness to embroil you with
perhaps the government itself. You already know that
Malus supposes himself seriously in danger from us, and
that so we are seriously in danger from him. But you
have not known distinctly who we are, and what we propose
to do. As to who we are, we are still compelled to
be silent; but it is fitting that you learn now the nature
of Cimon’s relations to Malus. Cimon is the dear friend
and business manager of an eastern trader who for many
years has had large dealings with Malus—consigning to
him a large amount of costly eastern goods yearly. We
now find, what has long been suspected, that the consignee
has made false returns as to the amount of goods
received, and prices obtained for them, and the duties
levied on them at this port. Complete proof of this, as
we suppose, is contained in the parcel of papers put into
your hands yesterday. We also cannot doubt that a comparison
of these papers with the custom house registers
(which comparison we have not been able to make) would
show that Malus has defrauded the government as well as
ourselves, and perhaps that officials are in collusion with
him. The interests he has at stake, therefore, are so
large that he is sure to be as bitterly hostile to our friends
as to us. And besides, as you see, he seems to have secured
a hold of some sort on the Roman authorities themselves.
So the man who undertakes to befriend us undertakes
a great deal. We are very reluctant to embroil
you, and perhaps the family of the Alabarch in so serious<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232">[232]</a></span>
a trouble. On this account we have refrained from asking
advice from you in regard to our preliminary movements.”</p>

<p>“The case as stated by you,” replied Seti, still with
the utmost coolness, “is not worse than I supposed; and
I still press my invitation. Trouble there will be, no
doubt; but, then, if I do not accept this trouble I shall
have a greater from another quarter; for my granddaughter
sent a messenger to me this morning as soon as
it was light to stir me up to do what I am now doing. If
I were to be backward in this matter,” he added with a
smile, “I am afraid she would rouse all my students
against me; which she could easily do, for she is a queen
to P. Cornelius. Moreover, it is barely possible that
both Alexander and myself have just a little of that generous
indignation at wickedness that led certain persons
of our acquaintance to stand up for us without counting
the cost. Who gave Greeks and Chaldeans a monopoly
of that sort of thing? No, friends, you must not ask
me to do what you would not, I am confident, be willing
to do yourselves.”</p>

<p>Of course nothing more was to be said. And our
friends said nothing more—save thanks. It was agreed
that they should send their effects at once to the Serapeum
by certain servants whom Seti had left without,
and follow them in person in the course of the day.</p>

<p>This matter being disposed of, Seti continued, “Now
tell me what steps you have taken to bring that arch-rogue
to justice.”</p>

<p>“I have done nothing,” said Cimon, “save to collect
evidence; and have been uncertain what further steps to
take.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233">[233]</a></span></p>

<p>“You should put your proofs at once in the hands of
Alexander’s lawyer. If he judges them sufficient for this
latitude and for a Roman Court (for a Roman Court it
must be, since the case is between a Greek and a Jew),
let him put things in train without delay. You could
find no more skillful advocate; and he has the further
advantage, somewhat rare in his profession, of being an
honest man. This in itself will instinctively enlist him
against such a rogue as Malus. He will do all he can to
bring the fellow to justice.”</p>

<p>“Can you tell me what the prospects for justice in a
Roman Court are?”</p>

<p>“The Roman law, in general, is just; but a case has
to be very clear or the strong rogues, in Alexandria as
elsewhere, will manage to escape by means of the evasions,
delays, appeals, and various tricks that are purchasable
by the free use of money. It is said that all
things are venal at Rome. I am afraid the state of things
is no better in Alexandria. Malus will use money freely—can
you do the same?”</p>

<p>“That depends,” said Cimon. “For such purposes
as the collecting of evidence and the securing of the
ablest advocate that can be had, I say <i>Yes</i> to your question.
For the purpose of bribing the judges, I say
<i>No</i>.”</p>

<p>“This is the answer I expected from you. But your
enemy has no scruples. He will have the freedom of all
means—righteous and unrighteous. In this respect he
has much the advantage over you—always provided that
there is no God, and that there is a devil. But in certain
other important respects you have an advantage over
him.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234">[234]</a></span></p>

<p>“Will you tell us in what?” suggested Aleph.</p>

<p>“First, in the intrinsic justice of your cause; for I
have no doubt that the case is as you have stated it.
Next, the evil repute of Malus among the better class of
people is against him. They all know that he is capable
of doing just the sort of thing you charge against him—that,
in fact, he has done it in multitudes of cases and has
only escaped by the terror which he inspires in people too
weak financially and otherwise to contend with him. It
is worth while for even Roman judges to make some account
of the higher grades of public opinion. Further,
it would not be strange if many of the small victims of
Malus should summon courage in the presence of so large
a suit as yours to appear against him with an amount of
testimony that would be overwhelming.”</p>

<p>“I understand then,” said Cimon, “that even if our
proofs are legally complete, we still have reason to fear
that venality on the part of the judges and hostility on
the part of the Governor and other officials will find
means to set them aside.”</p>

<p>“Yes—it certainly is to be feared. Malus has undoubtedly
patched up an alliance, if not with the Governor
himself, at least with Romans who can bring heavy
influence to bear upon him and so on the courts. We
must not shut our eyes on this fact. It is our main disadvantage.
But to offset this the Alabarch and myself
can also bring heavy influences—and they shall not be
wanting.”</p>

<p>“We are fortunate and thankful to find such friends—especially
as we have no choice but to proceed. We
will proceed and trust Heaven for the result. I think
this is the conclusion to which we have come, and that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_235" id="Page_235">[235]</a></span>
we are ready to authorize our friend to place our papers
in the hands of the advocate he proposes,” and he looked
inquiringly at Aleph.</p>

<p>Aleph slightly bowed. After a moment, however, he
added:</p>

<p>“Still I would be glad if, before legal proceedings are
begun, we could give Malus an opportunity to retrace his
steps. I would like to try what effect expostulation under
the perils of his situation would have. The Most
High practices forbearance to sinners; and such I understand
is the practice of the Messiah toward his enemies.
His miracles show that he has power enough to overwhelm
them all with the greatest ease, but he forbears and
tries on them the effect of more light and expostulation.
I would be glad to imitate God and His Christ.”</p>

<p>Seti started to his feet in amazement.</p>

<p>“And this after your very lives have been so foully
assailed! This way of doing things is neither Egyptian,
nor Greek, nor Roman, nor even Jewish—however God-like
and Christ like it may be.”</p>

<p>“I confess,” said Cimon, “that I have something of
the feeling that my young friend has expressed. I am
reluctant to drive a man to what may prove his ruin
without giving him a chance for his life. To be sure, I
have small hope of a favorable result from any appeal we
can make to the conscience and fears of Malus. But I
should feel easier if it were made.”</p>

<p>“Well, be it so!” said Seti after a short silence.
“Make the experiment. See what merciful dealings can
do. At the most, it only means the delay of a day or so....
Now let us see what you will <em>write</em> to this promising
candidate for repentance and reformation: for I will<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236">[236]</a></span>
never give my consent that you go in person into the den
of such a serpent.”</p>

<p>Aleph looked at Cimon. The Greek nodded. The
young man seated himself at a table and slowly wrote as
follows:</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“Cimon, manager and representative, to Malus, consignee
and merchant.</p>

<p>“It has been discovered that the returns which you
have made for many years to the business which I represent
are not in accordance with the facts, and that now a
very large sum of money is due us. I am reluctant to
appeal to the courts to enforce our claims; and hope that
your sense of justice and of responsibility to a Higher
Power will make such an appeal unnecessary. A satisfactory
assurance from you of regret for the past and an
upright purpose for the future will dispose me to abate
much from my just claim upon you.</p>

<p>“Let me hear from you to-day at the</p>

<p class="right"><i>Khan Rachotis</i>.”</p>

</div>

<p>“I have great misgivings as to this merciful plan of
yours,” said Seti, “and only give my consent to it on
condition that you authorize me to place your papers in
the hands of our advocate at once, without waiting to see
the result of your appeal. If it is successful you can recall
the parcel unbroken. Otherwise it is to be used
without delay. You agree?”</p>

<p>“So be it,” said Cimon.</p>

<p>“Does the parcel contain as full an explanation of the
case as the advocate will need?”</p>

<p>“So it seems to me.”</p>

<p>This ended the conversation. A servant of the khan<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_237" id="Page_237">[237]</a></span>
was immediately called and dispatched with the letter to
Malus. Seti himself remained till he had seen the main
effects of his friends put into the hands of two servants
of his own for transference to the Serapeum. It was
agreed that the owners should follow as soon as possible.</p>

<p>As chance would have it (I confess that I dislike such
language on both scientific and religious grounds), they
were not detained long. Their messenger met Malus at
no great distance from the khan; and soon returned with
a spoken message that they should either see or hear from
him at the khan early the coming evening.</p>

<p>What should they do in the meantime? Aleph consulted
his programme of lectures, and found that Seti
was to speak at the third hour in his course on Comparative
Religions—special topic, <i>The Religion of Egypt</i>.
They would settle with their landlord and then leisurely
find their way to the lecture. They were curious to hear
what the high-priest of Egypt would say about its religion.
Perhaps they would get some light on the mystery
of his position.</p>

<p>Accordingly, in due time they found themselves in
the lecture-room of the Serapeum. They noticed that
the room was fuller than before, and conjectured that
this was owing to the special interest felt in the topic to
be discussed. Seti evidently noticed their presence as he
came in and passed near them to his seat on the dais.</p>

<p>What follows is a condensed statement of the main
points of the lecture—without the vigorous argument and
abundant illustrations by which these points were supported.</p>

<p>Seti began with reminding the students that he had
in previous lectures on the origin and history of religion<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238">[238]</a></span>
expressed the conviction that its earliest stage in all
countries was monotheism. The evidence of this, he
thought to be especially clear in the case of Egypt. All
his researches had converged on a remote time when the
Egyptian temples contained no visible object of worship;
but were dedicated to a single spiritual Being who was
supposed to be the eternal, almighty, and all wise creator
of all things else, and who was to be worshipped by
prayer and praise and gifts and sacrifice. They called
Him <i>Amun Re</i>.</p>

<p>How long the popular religion remained at this point
is not known. Nor is it known by any record how a
change came to take place. But probably it was after
this manner. Some of the ruder people began to use
visible symbols of the Great Spirit to assist their conception
and devotion; and by degrees their example was
copied extensively by the people at large. The next step
was to pass from the worship of the Being symbolized to
the worship of the symbol itself—a thing about as easy as
the descent of rivers to the sea.</p>

<p>Before long there crept in a new element. The people
had all along believed, as all other nations have done,
in a multitude of invisible beings, intermediate between
the Supreme and man in dignity and faculty, and having
more or less influence over human fortunes. These,
whether supposed good or bad, the people gradually came
to think it worth while to propitiate by various services
and honors, very much as they were accustomed to do to
the various grades of powerful officials under the Pharaohs;
and in process of time the services and honors
given to these minor but nearer deities grew to overshadow
those of <i>Amun Re</i> himself.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_239" id="Page_239">[239]</a></span></p>

<p>This secondary worship, too, found symbols natural
and convenient. Its objects were invisible beings hard
to be conceived of and realized. In this case the familiar
animals of the country were taken as symbols. Foreigners
have sometimes wondered at this, and perhaps with
some reason; but there are not wanting philosophers who
say that even the humblest <em>living</em> creature is a more wonderful
object than any dead statue can be, though of the
most precious material and exquisite workmanship; and
that it better represents the wisdom and power of a living
spiritual being. Whatever one may think of the propriety
of this animal symbolism, it was certainly general
in Egypt at a very early period. And men went as naturally
from such a symbolism to a worship of the symbols
themselves as they did to sin and death.</p>

<p>But where, meanwhile, was the priesthood of <i>Amun
Re</i>? Through all these changes among the lower orders
the higher Egyptian priesthood held fast the original
theory of religion. To them there was still but one God
to whom religious worship should be paid, and He should
be worshipped without symbol. So they resisted the
downward drift—resisted it strongly. But the popular
current was too strong for them. And, after long struggling
against it unsuccessfully, they came by degrees to
feel that the lower orders are incapable of worthily grasping
and appropriating a strictly spiritual religion—that
the gross thoughts and cares and toils amid which their
lives are necessarily spent make a grosser form of religion
a necessity to them. The heavens are best read and understood
from eminences—how can the stars of the higher
truth be seen to advantage save from the eminences of
human life with their culture and leisure and broad outlook?<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240">[240]</a></span>
They cannot. It must not be expected. A spiritual
religion is not for the vulgar. It is too high and
sacred for common handling. It were a profanation of
the lofty and holy to put them into such hands as hold
our plows, work our quarries, and embalm our dead.</p>

<p>These views at first tolerated, then favored, next embraced
and justified, and finally established as a policy
and institution, made two worlds in Egypt, with a great
abyss between them, which have continued down to the
present time. On the one hand has been the world of
Pharaohs, priests and philosophers holding fast the primitive
religion of Egypt as a sacred Mystery: on the other
hand has been a world of peasants and idolaters judged
unfit for such high knowledge and carefully excluded
from it.</p>

<p>“Such,” continued Seti, “was the Egypt which I
found. Such was the policy, solid and venerable with
the approval and practice of thousands of years, that I
inherited. It was an ungrateful inheritance. I came
early to doubt its wisdom and righteousness; and by the
time when power came into my hands I had made up my
mind to resist and forsake it just as far and fast as possible.
I knew that a sudden change was not wisely possible.
I realized that reforms of ancient evils that have
become intertwined with the whole structure of society
must be carefully and gradually made. Else social convulsions
will follow. More damage would come from
violent and precipitate measures than would come from
the evil they attack. With the power of an emperor I
could not have wisely abolished the old order of things by
edict.</p>

<p>“All this I felt profoundly. And so when the supreme<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_241" id="Page_241">[241]</a></span>
priesthood came to me, while I determined to proceed at
once and thoroughly to the great problem of restoring our
religion to its primitive purity among the lower classes, I
also determined to proceed cautiously. I labored to
change the views of the priesthood already on the stage.
As director of all the schools for young priests, I sought
to shape their education toward the original order of
things. I enlarged as much as possible the number of
the initiated in the higher classes. I took pains (how
much some of you well know) to impress my views on the
young men gathered here for education from all parts of
the world—hoping that the truth would filter down
through the upper strata into the lower and the lowest.
And, further, I have persuaded and instructed the priests
who deal directly with the common people to push into
the background, more and more, the secondary deities—to
bring to the front, more and more, the Supreme One;
and to insist upon it that there be no worship of the
symbols of even Him, only of the Being symbolized; all
to prepare the way for withdrawing the symbols themselves.</p>

<p>“I may have been too lingering and indirect in my
action. Some of my friends think as much. It is not
easy to judge in such matters. I would be glad if we
could have a Divine Teacher, such as Plato craved,
to tell us with authority exactly what to do. But
until He comes (if indeed He has not already come)
we must take the course that seems to promise the
most good with the least harm. Unsuccessful violence
on the traditional religious habits of the people would be
likely to give us political and social convulsions which
would be bad enough: successful violence would be likely<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242">[242]</a></span>
to give us general atheism which would be worse. Young
men (and his voice grew graver and more emphatic as
his eye went searchingly around among the earnest faces),
Young men, remember that there is something worse than
worshipping Nilus, or the ibis: it is <em>the not worshipping
at all</em>.”</p>

<p>The students now supposed the lecture finished; but
after a silence of a few moments Seti added:</p>

<p>“Some of you may feel like asking how this course of
mine can consist with the position I hold as head of the
Egyptian religion. If an answer to this is not sufficiently
implied in what I have said already, let me add that I regard
myself as being the high-priest of the original religion
of Egypt, according to our ancient institutions; and
do not feel bound to the variations from it that have been
mistakenly introduced by others. Further, in the course
I am pursuing I have the approval of most of those who
have always had in charge the religious concerns of the
country—the higher priesthood. And still further, I am
not chargeable with double-dealing—for, as you will bear
me witness, I make no secret of my views and purposes;
and my position does not require me to officiate at the
worship of any secondary deity, but only at that of Amun
Re Himself. Even the symbols of Him under the name
of Serapis I do not now use either in public or private.
The statue of Him belonging to this temple has not been
before the public for a number of years.”</p>

<p>This concluded the lecture. But the young men, too
much interested in both the manner and the matter of
their teacher to be in any hurry to get away, were still
lingering in their seats, when a young man appeared at
the door and politely asked their attention. He said that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_243" id="Page_243">[243]</a></span>
he had been deputed by the Museum to lay a certain complaint
before them. It appeared that a stranger had been
received to student matriculation by the Serapeum without
actual testing in athletics. This step was certainly
very unusual, if not wholly unprecedented; and the Museum
felt obliged to complain of it after a fraternal and
gentlemanly fashion, and to ask that the ancient usage of
the University may not be violated.</p>

<p>Publius Cornelius sprang to his feet. “It is, I believe,
according to the ancient usage of the University
that the examination which satisfies one of its departments
shall satisfy the other also. I beg to inform Quintius
Metellus that we examined the candidate to whom
he refers as to athletic matters, and were abundantly satisfied
with the examination.”</p>

<p>“Still it appears,” blandly returned the somewhat
foppish and fast looking young Metellus, “that no
actual trial of strength and skill was made; and the Museum
cannot but think that if the new-comer is really deserving
of such exceptional treatment he will be willing
to content us with an actual instead of an imaginary testing
in the more advanced athletics. The Museum has
presumed on his willingness, and is at this moment present
in a body in your gymnasium awaiting his appearance.”</p>

<p>“This seems to me,” began P. Cornelius in a tone
just a little tinged with indignation—but Aleph, making
a sign to him, interposed:</p>

<p>“I beg,” said he, “that our president will not press
his view. I am quite willing to content the Museum,
and should be sorry to have any feel that an ancient
usage of the University has been unreasonably set aside<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_244" id="Page_244">[244]</a></span>
in my favor. I hope, therefore, that the Serapeum will
yield to the wishes of the Museum.”</p>

<p>“This is very satisfactory,” returned Q. Metellus.
“But I am also instructed to say that inasmuch as the
social standing of the new student is unknown to us, it
seems to us that the testing should be on the more gentlemanly
accomplishments. This will throw some light
on whether he is entitled to mingle on equal terms
with the representatives of the best families of the
empire.”</p>

<p>“Nonsense!” exclaimed P. Cornelius. “Use your
eyes, Metellus!”</p>

<p>But Aleph gravely said, “I do not object to the new
proposition of the Museum.”</p>

<p>“One more particular, and I have finished my mission.
The Museum also requests that the testing may be
by our professional teachers of equestrianism and fence.
The testing is likely to be more scientifically done; and
if well sustained will be more creditable to the candidate.
I hope he will gratify us also in this particular.”</p>

<p>“In this particular also,” said Aleph quietly—“assuming
that nothing unfair is intended, and that I shall
not be asked to attempt anything which the trainer is
not willing to attempt himself.”</p>

<p>“This condition is reasonable—do you accept it?”
demanded Cornelius. Receiving a nod of assent, he continued.
“Then we will proceed to the gymnasium—<em>under
protest</em>. I demur to the whole proceeding. Our new
associate is too compliant. The Museum is extravagant
and unreasonable. It will bear watching—Gentlemen of
the Serapeum!” he exclaimed, after a moment’s pause,
“I move you that we invite the venerable Seti to accompany<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_245" id="Page_245">[245]</a></span>
us to the gymnasium. It will conduce to order and
fairness.”</p>

<p>The suggestion was heartily ratified.</p>

<p>The gymnasium was near. The fair occupants of the
latticed gallery already mentioned, and of whose presence
some faint signs had appeared during the lecture, had
only to remove to the opposite side of the same large
room to command as good a view and almost as good a
hearing of what might pass in the gymnasium as they
had been having of the lecture room. Did they remove?
Who knows? Was the Gem of Alexandria, with her
lofty brow and shining eyes, among them? Who knows?
Certainly not Aleph the Chaldean.</p>

<p>The large court of the temple had been fitted up for
athletic exercises. We need only say in regard to it that
it was large enough to inclose a small hippodrome at the
centre; that on the right and left of a broad passage leading
down to this from the main entrance were tiers of
movable seats rising one above another. Those on the
left were already occupied by the Museum in full force
when the Serapeum came crowding in and took the seats
on the right. Then appeared Seti and took the seat of
honor in the middle of the passage. Last of all came P.
Cornelius and our two friends. These walked down at
once to the edge of the hippodrome, when Cimon took a
seat on the right, and Aleph and Cornelius remained
standing—</p>

<p>Before a man, who, a long whip in hand, was holding
at full length the rein of a superb looking horse with a
riding cloth strapped upon him.</p>

<p>“What do you wish?” said Aleph to the trainer in
equestrianism.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_246" id="Page_246">[246]</a></span></p>

<p>“Handle this Arabian in all ways—mount, trot
around the course, canter and gallop, maintain your seat
under shouts and the hissing of this whip.”</p>

<p>“Has this horse any peculiarities?” asked Cornelius.</p>

<p>“This the stranger is to find out for himself,” said
the trainer gruffly.</p>

<p>“The animal has the eye of a demon,” continued
Cornelius; “and it is agreed between the Museum and us
that you, Beco, are not to ask my friend to do what you
are not willing to undertake yourself. So I now ask you
to mount—in short, do yourself what you ask from him.”</p>

<p>“I am here to examine, not to be examined,” and
the man shrugged his shoulders and tried, unsuccessfully,
to look amused.</p>

<p>“Do you refuse?” demanded Cornelius.</p>

<p>“I refuse to be tested myself; I am not a candidate
for matriculation,” was the surly reply.</p>

<p>Cornelius looked anxiously around, and seeing the
trainer of the Serapeum standing not far away, he beckoned
to him; and on his approach conferred with him in
a low voice for a moment.</p>

<p>“It is as I thought,” he then cried out so that all
could hear; “our own equestrian trainer judges this animal
to be vicious and dangerous—evidently so dangerous
that he would not himself venture to attempt mounting
him. I appeal to the University against such unfairness!”</p>

<p>No notice was taken of this appeal; for by this time
both Serapeum and Museum were watching with breathless
interest the proceedings of Aleph.</p>

<p>After his first words to the trainer he seemed to take
no notice of what others were doing. His whole attention<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_247" id="Page_247">[247]</a></span>
was absorbed by the formidable animal before him.
Soon he stepped forward to the side of Beco, and stood
there for a few moments looking steadily into the flaming
eyes of the horse. Then he silently took the rein
into his hand and motioned Beco with his whip into the
background. There they stood alone for a while, confronting
each other—the soul of the man looking out of
his eyes, and the soul of the brute looking out of his—the
one calm, confident, masterful; the other brimful of willfulness,
resistance, determination, passion, and malignity.
Each of them seemed to be asking the other,
<i>Which of us shall be master?</i></p>

<p>Aleph began to draw gently on the rein. The horse
showed his teeth, champed his bit, struck the ground
fiercely with his forefoot, seemed on the point of springing
on his enemy. But Aleph gave not the slightest sign
of apprehension. Not the smallest movement that looked
toward self-protection was apparent. On the contrary, he
advanced a step, and, if possible, his attitude grew firmer,
his port more commanding, and his eyes shot out their
rays into the brute eyes with a still more confident majesty.
He saw the fierce eyes before him beginning to
soften, to waver. He advanced another step. He laid
his hand softly on the thin, quivering nostrils. He
began to speak—meanwhile caressing with a gentle
hand the soft nostril, the long forelock, the tapering
ears.</p>

<p>“You are one of ten thousand—finely formed, powerfully
built, full of grace and strength and spirit. A
steed for a warrior! But you are not an Arabian. Parthia
was your mother. And you are as wild as the wildest
of the Parthians. I do not think that you have ever<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_248" id="Page_248">[248]</a></span>
felt the weight of a man. You have been bitted, but
never ridden. You have been mismanaged and abused
till you think every man an enemy. It is a mistake.
You have at last found a friend. Now we understand
each other—do we not?”</p>

<p>The noble head had begun to droop toward the soothing
tones when Aleph, putting both arms with the rein
over it, drew it gently still lower, patted it, patted the
heavy mane, patted the proud arch of the neck, patted
the shapely flank, patted the royal curve of the back,
patted that royal curve with both hands—a moment more
was <em>seated</em> upon it, rein in hand.</p>

<p>What a bound there was then! The demon that had
been cast out came back seven-folded. But the horse
seemed to think that he had a demon on his back instead
of within him. He sprang into the air with such suddenness
and violence that one would have thought him
thunderstruck into a resolution to forsake the earth at
once and forever in favor of a higher sphere. Then followed
a rapid succession of pyrotechnic struggles, in
which was tried every sort of device and movement, save
that of falling, known to a horse, to free himself from
his burden. Such mighty wrath; such desperate and
frenzied exertions; such shakings and strikings and kickings
and rearings and plungings, and at last such runnings
away, had not been seen since the days of Bucephalus.
But during it all Aleph sat as if a part of the animal,
with no strain whatever on the rein, merely watchfully
accommodating himself to the various movements
of which he seemed to have some secret intelligence in
advance: and when the running began he only used the
rein to guide it according to the round of the arena.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_249" id="Page_249">[249]</a></span>
This was no easy matter—the speed was so great and the
round so small. Whether he would be able to prevent
the headlong courser from dashing through the seats occupied
by the Museum was so doubtful to those in the
front seats that they instinctively made a great outcry
and flourish of canes at the flying centaur. This added,
if possible, new wings to the flight: but Aleph so skillfully
combined the use of the rein with limb-pressure
and flexions that the round was safely made three times.
The quadruped hurricane then stopped of his own accord
at the starting point—all in a tremble and covered with
foam.</p>

<p>Aleph sprang from his back, caught up a large cloth
that lay near, gently wiped off the sweat from the trembling
animal, patted and stroked and soothed him with
hand and voice till he ceased to tremble.</p>

<p>Then taking his stand a little in front, he beckoned
and called. The horse instantly walked up to him. He
laid his hand on the mane, both hands; they grew heavier
and heavier, and still the animal stood motionless. A
moment more and Aleph was again mounted and pacing
slowly around the course. Arrived at the starting point,
he again dismounted, tightened the band that confined
the riding cloth, and then in a very leisurely way resumed
his seat.</p>

<p>“Now, friend Parthia, shall we trot?” A gentle
shake of the rein and Parthia trotted around the course
with a free and stately action.</p>

<p>“Now, friend Parthia, shall we see what you can do
in the way of the ornamental?” By this time the steed
had recovered his strength and spirit; and in perfect
obedience to rein and foot he curveted and pranced and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_250" id="Page_250">[250]</a></span>
caracoled about the arena after a most wonderful fashion.
But the greatest wonder was not the horse, but the horseman.
Such unaffected simplicity, ease, and repose of
manner! With what grace and even majesty he carried
himself! As he went his last round with the sunshine
on his royal face and the steed stepping as proudly under
him as if he knew that he carried a royal burden—ah,
<em>such</em> a shout went up from Serapeum and Museum both!
Aleph happened to look up and lo, on one side of the
arena, high up in the Serapeum, latticed windows were
all open and bright faces and forms were leaning out
waving snowy veils. The ladies of Alexandria, relying
on the absorption of the students, and perhaps forgetting
themselves in the intense interest of the scene, had gradually
pushed the lattice aside for the sake of a better
view: and when Aleph looked up and saw them he saw
also a bouquet of flowers in the air, and a fair hand that
had just parted with it, and a glorious face that he knew
behind the hand. The horse sprang to meet the descending
token; and as Aleph caught it in his hand, he, as
gallant knights should always do, bowed low, even to the
horse’s mane.</p>

<p>“Who owns this animal, thou villain?” exclaimed
Cornelius, with some fire in his voice and more in his
eyes, to the trainer.</p>

<p>The man tapped the ground uneasily with his whip,
and was silent.</p>

<p>Turning to the students, Cornelius cried, “Whoever
was the owner of this horse when he came here has forfeited
his claim. Let us declare it forfeited to the University,
and present the animal to Aleph, the Chaldean,
to be kept at our expense; and if the original owner dares<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_251" id="Page_251">[251]</a></span>
to claim him let us prosecute the wretch before the courts
for intent to kill one of us.”</p>

<p>Said Metellus, “I approve of that. It seems to me
that it would be a crime against society to reward the
man for his crime by replacing a horse worth considerably
less than nothing by one worth a thousand gold staters.
May I ask what the venerable Seti thinks?”</p>

<p>The venerable Seti thought that under the circumstances
the horse had a right to choose his own master—that
in fact he had already chosen, and chosen well. He
should have free keeping in the stalls of the Serapeum as
long as his master should choose.</p>

<p>The students ratified lustily.</p>

<p>In the meantime Aleph had dismounted and stood
holding the rein over one arm, while the other was thrown
caressingly over the arched neck of the horse. As he
gave the rein to a servant of the Serapeum who now presented
himself he said:</p>

<p>“I am glad if the Museum regards the trial thus far
as satisfactory. But there remains another trial to which
they have asked me to submit—that by their teacher of
fence. For this I am now ready”—and the flowers which
till now he had held in his hand he secured under his
girdle.</p>

<p>Then up spake Cornelius again. “I cannot but
think that the Museum is thoroughly satisfied already
with the justice of our matriculation. And to ask a
young man after such exertions as we have seen to pit
himself against a fresh man and a famous professional
seems to me wonderfully unreasonable. Besides, what
has occurred suggests the idea of bad faith somewhere.
Of course the Museum does not mean anything of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_252" id="Page_252">[252]</a></span>
sort; but in my opinion they are being made tools of by
somebody who has a deadly purpose to serve. Unless
Draco of Rhodes is a better and fairer man than Beco the
Roman, he can be hired to commit a murder.”</p>

<p>“It must be confessed,” said Q. Metellus, who had
come forward and was now standing by the side of Cornelius,
“that the Museum has made but a sorry show
here to-day, either as a tool or worse; and I should not
much blame P. Cornelius if he had taken a worse view of
us than he does. We have had a most instructive time,
but no thanks to the Museum for it. We were trapped
into it. For my part I disclaim all fellowship with Beco
and his proceedings; and if I could think it possible that
another such scoundrel could be found attached to the
Museum I should be tempted to forsake it for cleaner
quarters. If I should wish the examination to proceed
further it would be solely for the purpose of vindicating
our good name and showing that Beco is the only devil
among us.”</p>

<p>On this arose another young man among the benches
of the Museum who commended in a general sort of way
the remarks of Metellus; but then said that the Museum
had formally taken the ground that it was not proper to
take any accomplishment for granted, saving as the
higher includes the lower. It would not only be inconsistent
but an unfortunate precedent should they leave
the testing incomplete. To be sure, the young man who
calls himself Aleph the Chaldean has borne himself well
thus far; still he might wholly fail under the remaining
test. Certainly the Museum, however well satisfied at
present, would be better satisfied if the whole plan
agreed upon should be carried out. He did not anticipate<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_253" id="Page_253">[253]</a></span>
another Beco in Draco. No doubt Draco would be
forbearing with the young man, and would only tax him
enough to make a reasonable trial of his skill in the gentlemanly
art of fence. For this purpose no dangerous
weapons need be used—only the open hands. As the
candidate did not seem to be at all worn by what he had
done, let him have a chance to win new laurels from
Draco of Rhodes.</p>

<p>Some of the Museum applauded.</p>

<p>“But Euphemes of Corinth should consider,” began
P. Cornelius; but Aleph laid his hand on his arm and
said, “Excuse me, my friend.”</p>

<p>Then turning toward the Museum, he added in a voice
that had in it a touch of humor as well as several touches
of decision, “I beg that the Museum may be gratified by
the complete carrying out of the plan they have proposed.
I do not ask for exceptions in my favor, either
from my fellow students or from your teacher of fence.
Let him do his best—provided he deal fairly and honorably.”</p>

<p>This settled the matter, though Cornelius and some
others, especially of the Serapeum, looked and muttered
discontent. “It is too bad. Talk of fairness and honor
in connection with such a desperado as Draco! Depend
upon it there is some wickedness in the wind. When
such a fellow comes to the front the gods retire.”</p>

<p>And he <em>was</em> a formidable figure to look at, as he presented
himself in the arena. A man of unusual stature
and weight, with prodigious muscular development about
the arms and chest, but without obesity and with every
appearance of activity as well as of strength. His face
was the worst part of him—shaggy, coarse, hard, cruel,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_254" id="Page_254">[254]</a></span>
with protuberant blood-shot eyes out of which looked all
the passions save fear and pity—the whole made more repulsive
by a large swelling on one cheek which Aleph
well understood.</p>

<p>To this forbidding figure Aleph walked down (followed
at a little distance by Cornelius and Metellus) and
stood before him with folded arms and investigating eyes.</p>

<p>Draco proceeded to pass his hands across the shoulders
and chest of the young man; felt of his arms; took
their length; inspected his hands; stood off a little distance
to observe the limbs and general build.</p>

<p>“Very well to begin upon. I think I could make
something of you. Not quite enough like Mars, however.”
Then, taking the attitude of a boxer, he said,
“Now deliver some blows at me with your open hand.”</p>

<p>Aleph made certain strokes which were more remarkable
for the freedom and grace with which they were delivered
than for anything else, and which Draco found
no difficulty in parrying. None of them were aimed at
the face; but once the low stroke was so struck up by
Draco in the parrying that the hand touched the swollen
cheek. Draco’s eyes flashed.</p>

<p>In this preliminary bout it became evident to Aleph,
from the force and direction of the parrying, that Draco
was aiming to disable as well as to parry. His wards
were strokes—his defense an attack.</p>

<p>“Now take your turn at parry,” said Draco with a
subtle menace lurking in both eye and voice.</p>

<p>Aleph saw that the time had come when he would
need all his watchfulness. He erected himself to a fuller
stature. His feet and limbs set themselves into new
firmness. His eye took on new openness and intensity<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_255" id="Page_255">[255]</a></span>
without losing anything of its characteristic repose. He
had hardly made this instinctive preparation before the
blows began to come—at first with some show of tentativeness
and moderation, but, as they were warded off,
they returned with ever increasing heat and force, and
gradually came to be aimed exclusively at the head.
Now it was the mouth, now the eye, now the temple.
He seemed bent on at least marring the manly beauty before
him, and which contrasted so strangely with his own
coarse and brutal features. Gradually the open palm became
the knotted fist. Gradually the knotted fist came
as fast and fiercely as the whole passionate force of the
man could wield it.</p>

<p>Through the whole of this impetuous hail storm,
Aleph kept strictly on the defensive. His whole work
was parrying. Was not this in the bond? Of course his
hands were full of occupation—his feet also when Draco
began to shift positions and at length attacked him on
whatever side and from whatever direction he could.
Aleph hardly had time to wonder at the headlong ferocity
of the storm that was discharging itself upon him.</p>

<p>“<em>Stop!</em>” cried Cornelius. “This is fighting, not
examining. <em>Stop!</em> I say—this is intolerable.”</p>

<p>But Draco paid no attention. The glare of a tiger
was in his eyes. His face was that of a fiend.</p>

<p>“Shall I quit the defensive?” inquired Aleph in a
low voice to Cornelius and Metellus—as he gained a moment’s
respite by a spring to one side.</p>

<p>“Do so!” they both exclaimed. “He means to kill
you.”</p>

<p>Then was a sight worth seeing. Then the youth
fairly awoke. Then his whole frame began to work with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_256" id="Page_256">[256]</a></span>
the supreme grace and force of some mighty machine. It
was Apollo turned to Mars, or rather to Jupiter Tonans
himself—so wonderfully sovereign and commanding became
his aspect. And perhaps the most impressive thing
about it was the mysterious repose and utter self-possession
that sat on thrones in every feature.</p>

<p>Compared with his movements now, all his former
ones were mere pastime. It was sublime to see such a
face, such a figure, such a blending of all the poetries of
expression and motion. He still parried, but every parry
was followed by a blow delivered. Swifter and stronger
flew that young hand. He, too, could be swift and
mighty—he, too, could press, now on this side and now
on that, and again, seemingly, on all sides at once. And
yet his breathing was unhurried—there seemed in him
endless reserves of strength and battle.</p>

<p>“Immortal gods! how he handles himself,” exclaimed
young men as they stood on their benches and
watched breathlessly.</p>

<p>Almost as soon as the defensive became the aggressive,
a severe stroke on his swollen cheek warned Draco
that he must begin to look to self-preservation. He
could no longer give his whole attention to assault. He
became vividly sensible of the great change that had
taken place in the aspect and bearing of his antagonist.
He saw how cool and collected he was—how perfectly
master of himself. The sight angered him, made him
furious. He would have given his life for one fair demolishing
stroke on the young man on whom as yet he
had not been able to fasten a single bruise. But scant
time had he now for even such flashes of thinking. He
had all he could do to ward off the blows that came so<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_257" id="Page_257">[257]</a></span>
mightily and swiftly, and yet with a certain deliberate
terribleness and ease that seemed to say that such could
be delivered forever. Soon another blow passed his ward
and reached the cheek hitherto untouched. But it was
with the palm of the hand. Was Aleph affecting to be
forbearing and merciful to him who had never given
mercy nor needed it? Was he, like some perverse boy,
being cuffed into good behavior? The thought was intolerable.
That a youngster of a score of summers
should be sparing him—conquering him with even something
less than his utmost, was agony. And yet that was
what everybody could now see was bound to happen. It
was plain to see that Draco was waning and that Aleph
was waxing. The sweat was dropping freely from the
face of the one; the brow of the other was not perceptibly
moist. Spectators could see that the young man
often voluntarily neglected advantages that the passion
and precipitation of his adversary gave him, and was
seeking to close the contest with as little damage and
mortification to him as possible. After one of these plain
forbearances he said to Draco in a low voice:</p>

<p>“Need this go on? Say that you are satisfied with
the examination and we will stop just here. You have
for some time been in my power.”</p>

<p>For answer the infuriated man leaped at him with the
expression of a fiend, and tried to throw his arms about
him and bear him to the ground. So sudden and violent
was the movement that Aleph eluded it with some difficulty;
but he did it, and, in passing, dealt the ill-balanced
man a blow that felled him to the ground. He lay
motionless.</p>

<p>“He is not injured—only stunned,” said Aleph to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_258" id="Page_258">[258]</a></span>
Cornelius and Metellus as they came up. They looked at
the speaker and wondered. Not a blow appeared to have
reached him. There was no visible disarrangement of his
dress even. The flowers at his girdle were still in place.
And the supremely cool and masterful look that had presided
through the whole contest was still sitting in full
glory on its throne.</p>

<p>The issue had been anticipated by the students for
some time; but their breathless interest in watching the
conflict had kept them from any general vocal expression.
But now there was <em>such</em> an uproar—such a waving of
canes and caps, such stamping and clapping and lung-rending
huzzaing as a thousand frenzied young men could
make, and such as the old Serapeum had not known for
many a day, if ever. Did Seti make any effort to suppress
or moderate? Not he. Some even go so far as to
say that he was seen unconsciously keeping time to the
uproar with his foot. Others say (and I am disposed to
think they are right) that he sat as motionless as the
statue of Memnon, sat as if in a dream, till the tumult
had somewhat subsided. Then he held up his hand. Silence
at once reigned.</p>

<p>“Young men of the Museum! I cannot think that
any considerable number of you have been knowingly concerned
in this conspiracy. Were it otherwise it would be
to the eternal disgrace of the University, and especially
of your part of it. I prefer to think, and <em>do</em> think, that
you have been victims. You could not have supposed
that it was intended to assail the very life of a young man
under pretense of testing his athletic accomplishments.
You have been misled and deceived by somebody. I leave
you to find out who inspired and contrived this whole<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_259" id="Page_259">[259]</a></span>
thing. It is necessary for your good name. And I shall
not wonder if you decline henceforth to have anything to
do with these two professional trainers who have allowed
themselves to be used for murderous purposes.</p>

<p>“Perhaps some, if not all, of you have thought it
strange that I did not interfere to break off this contest
when its true character became plain. I was on the point
of doing so several times: but as I looked at the young
man I seemed to see in his whole bearing such abundant
promise of a successful issue that I felt it would be a
wrong to all of you young men to keep from you an inspiring
example, and a wrong to him to keep him from
the honor to which he is so justly entitled.”</p>

<p>“The venerable Seti is right,” cried Metellus. “We
of the Museum are no better than we should be;
but we are not sunk so low as to take part in a plot
against the life or limb of a stranger who has done us no
harm—much less against a member of our own University.
We have been imposed upon. We supposed that
nothing but a reasonable and safe testing was intended:
we even supposed that less danger would attend it under
our trainers than would naturally belong to an emulative
contest between students.</p>

<p>“It would be a farce for me,” he continued, “to ask
the Museum to vote as to whether the examination of the
candidate has been satisfactory. There is not one of us
but would throw his cap to the moon in token of approval.
Of course we adopt the hero into the Museum
by a thunder of silent acclamation. We have seen something
to-day to tell to the old folks at home—something
to tell to our children,” he added smiling. And then
with a graver face and a graver tone he went on, “And<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_260" id="Page_260">[260]</a></span>
somehow I feel as if I should go away from this place a
truer and worthier man for what we have seen to-day. I
had heard of magnanimity before; to-day I have seen it.
And I like it. Heroism is good, but heroism with righteousness
is better. I see that it is possible to come down
on a great deed, which is even better than rising to
meet it.</p>

<p>“But though the Museum does not need to vote approval
of Aleph the Chaldean (what a ridiculous thing it
would be!), I think we owe it to ourselves to act on the
suggestion of the venerable Seti; to express formally our
condemnation of these villains (the one lying here where
he ought to lie, and the other standing yonder dangling
a whip which ought to make many a weal across his own
back) and their prompters, whoever they may be. Have
we any further need of the services of trainers who are
themselves trained by the infernals? I think not.
Those agreeing with me will stretch out their hands.”</p>

<p>As far as Metellus could see, every right hand was
lifted.</p>

<p>What congratulations were showered on Aleph, how
cordial and admiring both Serapeum and Museum seemed,
how profuse the latter were in their disclaimers and
apologies and promises to unearth the whole plot, and
how modestly Aleph carried himself under it all, I will
not attempt to set down in detail.</p>

<p>“Come with me,” said Seti to our friends, as the students
broke up, “and I will show you your new quarters.”
On the way they told him of their arrangement
to meet Malus at the khan in the evening, but promised
to return immediately after to the Serapeum. At the
door of their apartments a servant met them and said to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_261" id="Page_261">[261]</a></span>
the priest that his granddaughter was in her sedan at the
gate and wished to see him. Would he come at once?
She was looking very pale and ill. Seti at once threw
open the door, bade them enter and be at home, and hastened
after the servant.</p>

<p>He did not appear again that day. Very likely he
went home with Rachel. And very likely Aleph would
have followed in the course of the afternoon, had not Cimon
happened to mention that he overheard a student
saying that news had just come that the emperor had
asked the daughter of the Alabarch in marriage for his
nephew and heir Germanicus, and that the visit of the
Alabarch to Rome had reference to this overture. “Perhaps,”
added Cimon, “this is what has disturbed her.”</p>

<p>“She would never marry a pagan,” said Aleph decidedly.</p>

<p>“Perhaps Germanicus is such a pagan as her grandfather,”
returned Cimon. “He is said to be a very
promising young man, and the son of excellent parents;
and no doubt the Jewish elders will be greatly in favor of
an alliance that promises to secure and advance their interests
so greatly. They will remember Queen Esther.”</p>

<p>Aleph made no answer—unless the silent one of drawing
out the knot of flowers from his girdle and setting
them carefully with water in a vase which he had discovered
in the room. But <em>was</em> this an answer? If so, it
certainly was not a very clear one. Did it say <i>No</i> to Cimon?
Did it say that his suggestions were not as weighty
as they might be? Did it merely say that the rare and
lovely flowers were worth preserving for a day or two on
their own account—whether they came from a future empress
of Rome or not? Or did the <em>heart</em> of the young<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_262" id="Page_262">[262]</a></span>
man really speak in the act without consulting his judgment—as
hearts sometimes do? I am at a loss. Such
Delphic conduct is very embarrassing. Why will people
put interpreters to so much trouble? If I had been Aleph
I would have—but no matter what I would have done.
What does the public care?</p>

<p>Seti found Rachel sitting in her sedan and looking
more like collapsed alabaster than a human being—her
eyes closed, every trace of color gone from her cheek,
and yet with an expression that told of a desperate struggle
for self-mastery.</p>

<p>She opened her eyes as she felt Seti’s hand on her arm.</p>

<p>“O grandfather, how <em>could</em> you allow that dreadful
combat to go on!”</p>

<p>“What, have you then been a witness of it all? I
had forgotten that it was possible. My poor child—it
was indeed too much for any lady, save a Roman accustomed
to a Roman arena!”</p>

<p>“I had no idea of what was coming when I went over
to the other side of the gallery with the rest. And they
pressed me to the best window for seeing and hearing:
once there I was under a spell. I could not tear myself
away. I felt obliged to see and hear though I died in the
act. Every sense was acute beyond anything I can remember.
Oh how I suffered at the earlier stages of that
last conflict! It seemed as if I could neither stay nor get
away. It was awful. I was amazed that my companions
did not seem to mind the scene as I did. Why did you
not interfere?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_266" id="Page_266">[266]</a></span></p>

<p>“I hardly understand why, myself. But probably it
was the confidence which the whole bearing of the young
man, and his superb physique, in which he surpasses all I
have ever known—probably it was the confidence that
these inspired that he would be more than equal to the
occasion. Still, now that it is all over, I wonder at myself
somewhat.”</p>

<p>“But suppose that brute of a horse, or that greater
brute of a man, had killed him? I shudder to think of
it. I had no idea that anything could have shaken me
so.” She closed her eyes and involuntarily trembled.</p>

<p>“But,” she added in a moment, “this is not all. I
received this morning from my mother a letter which
moved me greatly and perhaps unfitted me to bear the
scene in the palæstra as well as did the other young ladies.
Between the two I feel too weak to go home alone: besides,
I want your counsel. Can you not go with me?”</p>

<p>Seti went with her.</p>

<p>The following is a copy of the letter—omitting the
usual epistolary preliminaries—which Seti read and pondered
that afternoon:</p>

<p>“My dear Rachel, you know how little I thought of
remaining in Jerusalem till now. But our relative Nicodemus
has been urgent, and such great things have been
happening here that I have felt more like sending for you
and your father to come to me than like returning home.</p>

<p>“My dear daughter, you doubtless have wondered that
hitherto I have said so little in my letters of Jesus of
Nazareth (as he is called here), though you have seemed
so anxious to hear about him. The fact is that the ideas
of the Messiah to which I have been accustomed and
which are held by the chief people here, have made it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_267" id="Page_267">[267]</a></span>
hard for me to feel my way to a definite and settled
opinion; and I have been unwilling to write much on a
subject in regard to which my mind was in so confused
and uncertain a state. But I have at last—after much
prayer, and much study of the prophets, and much inquiry
of credible witnesses, as well as some seeing with
my own eyes—come to see my way clearly. Yes, my dear
daughter, I do indeed feel sure at last that Jesus is our
long-expected Messiah. If the proofs of this which he
furnishes are not sufficient it seems impossible to prove
anything. Even Moses himself did not more clearly establish
his Divine mission.</p>

<p>“Nicodemus has helped me not a little. He is a very
cautious man—I think somewhat too cautious and slow;
as is not unnatural to one who has so much to lose—but
at home he makes no secret of his conviction that it is
impossible to account for the wonderful deeds of Jesus
save on the supposition that God is with him. I hope
this influential man will soon get courage to speak out.</p>

<p>“When I came here I found the reality of Jesus’s
miracles admitted; and, after I had learned the character
of his life and teaching, I did not see how they could be
accounted for reasonably by the magical art and evil
spirits. But I have lately fallen in with some of his disciples,
and especially with some friends of his at Bethany,
who have given me a more clear and connected view of
his doings and teachings than I had before. At Bethany
I met the mother of Jesus—a wonderful woman, whom to
see and hear is to believe. In answer to my inquiries, she
told of the strangest possible events preceding and following
the birth of Jesus—of an angelic annunciation, of
a Divine conception, of the birth at Bethlehem, of shepherds<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_268" id="Page_268">[268]</a></span>
sent by a glory of angels to worship the child, of a
caravan of princes from the far east who came, star-guided,
to do him homage, of a flight to Egypt, of their
return on the death of Herod to live at Nazareth in Galilee
till Jesus was thirty years old, of how good and holy
he was during all those years, so that she never saw a fault
in him, though much that was mysterious. She had sometimes
felt oppressed by the mystery which always hung
about him like a silver veil, but through which occasionally
struggled gleams of a Divine majesty and power. As
time rolled on, and the child had long since become the
mature man, she wondered that so many years were allowed
to pass before his making any public movement.
But she knew that it would come in due time: God would
be as good as His word; such preparations and heralding
would not be an idle flourish and make-believe. Then
she went on to tell me about his forerunner and baptism
and first miracle near three years ago; and of the many
miracles she had seen since. While listening to his teaching,
she had been quite as much astonished at his wisdom
as she had been at his power. It was a very strange feeling
the mother had when she found herself looking up to
her son as being immeasurably above her in everything.
Still she rejoiced in the fact with a sort of awful joy.</p>

<p>“As she told me all these things there was so much
simplicity and truthfulness, as well as intelligence, shining
in her face and whole manner, that I could not but
accept her testimony. Then how I wanted to see <em>him</em>!
This I had never done until a few days ago. And it was
in this way:</p>

<p>“Have I said that the house in Bethany where I saw
Mary the mother of Jesus was the house of one Lazarus<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_269" id="Page_269">[269]</a></span>
and his two sisters? One day when I was there Lazarus
complained of feeling unwell. The sisters, Mary and
Martha, did some trifling thing for him and thought no
more of it. But, instead of improving, he grew worse. A
leech was called in. Still the brother grew worse. Day
by day the shadows deepened, until at last the leech himself
confessed that he could do no more. Then the sisters
said, ‘Though the leeches cannot help Lazarus, there is
one who can;’ and they immediately sent off a messenger
to Jesus, who was then in Galilee. Day after day passed
and still no Jesus came. Meanwhile the sick man pined
and wasted, and the home and hearts grew darker and
darker, and at last the leech said there was no hope. No,
no hope in <em>him</em>, or such as he, but still hope in Jesus that
he would bring or send help. Can it be that he will suffer
his friend to die?—he who has cured all sorts of diseases
for all sorts of persons with whom he had no special
tie?—I was there and saw the struggle between hope and
despair: saw despair finally triumph as last words were
spoken, as the breath came gaspingly, as the light faded
from the eye and the pulse from the wrist and—he was
gone. Close his eyes, O friends; straighten out the stiffening
limbs; let the mourning women come! Lazarus
is dead—<em>dead</em>.</p>

<p>“The sisters gave themselves up to their grief. They
refused to be comforted. They could not understand that
dreadful silence. Had the seemingly inexhaustible fountains
of power and helpfulness really given out? At all
events, all was now over. Nothing remained but to bury
their dead, and wait with streaming eyes and broken
hearts for their own turns to come. And the sooner they
should come the better.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_270" id="Page_270">[270]</a></span></p>

<p>“So the dead was buried, the lament made, and the
sisters sat down with despair for companion in a home
where midnight had come in place of midday. Some of us
sat with them as much as we could—holding their hands in
silent sympathy. What could words do in such a case!
We answered their groans with a pressure of the hand.
We followed their tears with our own. Every now and
then, amid their tears and groans, they exclaimed, ‘If
he had been here our brother had not died—had not
died.’</p>

<p>“So three days wore away—carrying with them what
little was left of the light in their eyes and the color in
their cheeks. On the fourth day, while I was sitting
with them, some one came in and whispered to Martha.
She at once rose and hastened out. But Mary sat still—not
even appearing to notice the departure of her sister.
So we continued sitting. But it was not long before Martha
returned with flurried haste, and with an expression
on her face that seemed like the first faint gray of dawn
on the edge of a black bank of clouds. Mary started up
at a whisper from her, and with something of the same
expression on her face followed her out. We followed,
too; for we thought that our sympathetic presence at the
grave where we supposed they were going might still be
helpful to the stricken sisters.</p>

<p>“And now, my dear daughter, prepare to read something
wonderful. My hand trembles as I proceed to
write it; and sometimes when I have thought of it such
an awe has come over me that I could not have then
written at all. But my nerves are now steadier. Behold
what happened!</p>

<p>“As we neared the cave where Lazarus had been laid<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_271" id="Page_271">[271]</a></span>
away, we saw a group of men. Mary darted forward and
threw herself at the feet of one of them. Then I understood
it all. Jesus and his disciples had at last come. I
did not need to hear her say, ‘Lord, if thou hadst been
here my brother had not died;’ for, as I looked with all
my eyes of both body and mind, on the face that was looking
down so compassionately on the weeping woman, I
saw at once the original of the picture that his mother
had made for me. I never had seen such a face. I do
not expect ever to see another like it. I do not speak of
its beauty, though beauty was not wanting; nor of its
majesty, though majesty was not wanting; but of a mysterious
something that seemed to lie back of and shine
dimly through the comeliness and the kingliness—a power
behind the throne greater than the throne itself; more
beautiful than the beauty, more majestic than the majesty;
a certain something so pure, so wise, so mighty,
and yet so loving and pitiful, that Divinity himself seemed
looking through the windows of flesh. This was how he
seemed to me. It may be that he does not make the same
impression on all; indeed, I know that he does not. And
even to me, while I looked, there was a sensible coming
and going of the Divine expression—like a rapid flowing
and ebbing on the strand of a boundless sea of mingled
fire and foam. Nay, while I was absorbed in watching
him the Infinite seemed to sweep back and back, and at
last disappeared altogether—leaving nothing but the
purely human. But oh, what a human! The sands laid
bare were pure gold. So gentle, so tender, so sympathetic
as his tearful eyes rested on the tearful people—a frightened
dove or hind would have taken refuge in his bosom.
Mary evidently took refuge there.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_272" id="Page_272">[272]</a></span></p>

<p>“‘Where have you laid him?’ said the most sympathetic
voice in the world.</p>

<p>“‘Come and see,’ said the sisters; and led the way to
one of the tombs close by. The cave was wrought into
the brow of a hill, and was closed by a door against which
rested a large stone.</p>

<p>“‘Take away the stone,’ said Jesus; and as he spake
I seemed to see the Infinite coming back into his face with
a mighty rush and completely covering the merely human
out of sight.</p>

<p>“We were breathless with expectation.</p>

<p>“He stood for a moment with eyes uplifted and lips
that moved—as if communing with the sky. Then, in
a voice that had in it such a commanding quality, such a
tone of unquestioned and unquestionable supremacy as I
had never before noticed in any voice, and which seemed
able to speak a world out of nothing, he cried:</p>

<p>“‘<span class="smcap">Lazarus, come forth!</span>’</p>

<p>“Would the dead hear? I <em>knew</em> he would hear. The
voice itself predicted a resurrection; and I felt in every
fibre of my being that almightiness was present and failure
impossible. And yet how intently I gazed on the
door of that tomb—how intently I listened for some sound
from within! He scarcely had done speaking, when, sure
enough, there was within the cave a stir, a rustle, a <em>step</em>.
Another moment and the heavy door swung open, as of
itself, and a man in grave-clothes appeared. The swathing
bands were still about his hands and feet—the napkin
was still about his face.</p>

<p>“‘Loose him and let him go!’ bade Jesus.</p>

<p>“The people obeyed, and lo, our friend Lazarus of
old! Not the fever-stricken, delirium-haunted, emaciated<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_273" id="Page_273">[273]</a></span>
Lazarus of a few days ago, who could not have stood
on his feet without being wholly supported; but the Lazarus
of his best days, able to go and come and do with
the best. Also, looking as he did then, but with a difference.
The mystery of the unseen was in his face. He
seemed in possession of vast secrets. With this was a look,
first of bewilderment and surprise, then of recognition—recognition
of him whose potential word had brought him
back to the world. He knelt at the feet of Jesus, and
kissed his hand—as men do homage to their king. <em>His</em>
King had come.</p>

<p>“Any doubt whether the death was real? Not to those
who, like myself, had seen the sick man decline from day
to day until the last feeble breath was drawn and the
body grew cold and stiff. Not to those who prepared the
body for burial and carried it forth to the tomb. Not to
those who stood by the cave-mouth when the door swung
back, four days after; nor to those who took off from the
living man the cerements of the dead. The smell of
death could not be mistaken. No, there is no doubt.</p>

<p>“Since then I have seen Jesus several times, and have
talked with him. And I <em>know</em> that he is our Messiah.
Would that you and your grandfather and all the dear
family could see and hear him too! I feel that you all
would, and must, judge as I do. Both my eyes and my
heart recognize him. I seem to know him by a new
internal sense.</p>

<p>“Not so, however, our chief men. He does not impress
them as he does me. They are getting exceedingly bitter
against him. Every new wonder increases their exasperation.
I am ashamed to say it—but I have no doubt
that they would gladly take his life. It must be that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_274" id="Page_274">[274]</a></span>
they are judicially blinded; or, if not, that an evil mood
of the heart and will wonderfully hinders perception in
religious matters.</p>

<p>“I would like to say more; but I hope to see you soon,
and to make you a joyful sharer of my faith by a fuller
account of what I have seen and heard.</p>

<p>“But what is this that I hear? Hints come to me
almost daily about you and the great alliance. And yet
you said nothing about it in your last. Just before he
left for Rome, your father wrote me that the emperor had
made proposals for you in behalf of his nephew and heir;
and that this was partly the occasion of his going to Rome.
I hope that you will speak freely in your next. I can see
what great advantage to our people, not to say to all
peoples, might come from such an alliance; especially as
I hear the best things said of the young Cæsar. He is
said to be like his excellent father. Is it possible that a
daughter of mine will become more than a second
Esther?”</p>

<p>Such was the letter—omitting the usual formalities of
beginning and ending. While Seti was reading it, Rachel
kept her eyes fastened anxiously on his face—especially
as he approached the end. When at last he looked up,
she came and stood before him and put a hand on each
shoulder and looked beseechingly into his eyes.</p>

<p>“Grandfather, had you known of this before?”</p>

<p>Seti slowly bowed his head.</p>

<p>“Why did not my father tell me?”</p>

<p>“Perhaps he did not want to agitate you unnecessarily—perhaps
he wanted to see the young man and
make inquiries about him, and learn more fully from the
emperor himself all that was implied in the proposals<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_275" id="Page_275">[275]</a></span>
before allowing you to be troubled with the matter. You
see it was possible that such inquiries might show it best
to decline the offer without its coming before you at
all.”</p>

<p>“Grandfather, let it <em>never</em> come before me. In advance,
I put it away from me with both hands.” And
then suddenly: “Do you think father would be willing to
sacrifice me, I do not say to ambition, for I know him
incapable of that, but to what he thinks to be the interests
of his people?”</p>

<p>“I think,” said Seti slowly, “that he might be willing
to sacrifice himself for such an object, but would feel
that he has no right to sacrifice you. Sacrifices of this
sort must be voluntary.”</p>

<p>“Then I am safe,” she exclaimed, “for my will is all
another way, and it has passed beyond my control. If a
victim is needed for our people, let father lay me on an
altar of stone or earth, as did our father Abraham his son
Isaac, and I will die by his hand gladly; but to die all
my life long on such an altar as Tiberius—this is beyond
my power, even for the good of Israel. It seems to me
an awful wickedness. I abhor the very thought of it.”</p>

<p>“And so do I,” said Seti. “I do not believe in doing
evil that good may come, pagan though I——” (she put
her hand over his mouth). “But they say that Germanicus
is not a Tiberius, but is like his father, who was
among the very best of the Romans, both in character
and accomplishments; and is it not just possible that if
the young man should come here in person to plead his
own cause you would——”</p>

<p>“I would <em>not</em>, grandfather; if he should come to me
with his head weighted with all the diadems that ever<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_276" id="Page_276">[276]</a></span>
were worn, and with all the personal accomplishments
that ever managed to flourish on a heathen, I would turn
my back upon him. There, now! Bear witness, ye
heavens!”</p>

<p>“I think I understand you,” replied Seti, after a moment.
“I feel very much as you do about this matter,
heathen though——” (she again hurried her hand to his
mouth). “But do not speak in this way to others. I see
that the matter is getting abroad, and you will be likely
to get hints, inquiries, counsels, congratulations from
many quarters. Take refuge in silence. By all means
do not look like an empress, and an angry one, as you did
just now. You shall not be crowded into the imperial
throne for the sake of Israel, or for any other sake.”</p>

<p>She kissed him for answer; laid her head on his
bosom; and, exhausted, went to sleep as he softly stroked
her shapely head. So he sat and held her in his arms
till the day was spent, and the old moon in the arms of
the new looked in at the casement, and saw the new
moon in the arms of the old. And those moons aloft
that are never weary, and worried, and worn, shed tears
over the sublunary ones whose lot is so different—tears
which the very early risers in Alexandria, the next morning,
mistook for dew. They were plain people; and, like
most in University towns, were not much wiser for the
University.</p>

<span class="smaller">THE VANISHING.</span></h3>

<p>Early the next morning Seti knocked at the door
of our friends. Getting no answer, he repeated the
knock. Still hearing nothing, he opened the door and
went in. The room was vacant; as was also the sleeping-room
adjoining. Plainly the latter had not been
occupied during the night. He was alarmed.</p>

<p>Summoning two servants to follow him, he proceeded
to the khan with rapid steps. What was his dismay to
learn from the landlord that, shortly after Cimon and
Aleph came in, the evening before, a body of the city
police appeared and demanded to search their room for
jewelry stolen from the warehouse of Malus. Permission
being readily given, the Cretan agent of Malus, well
known in the city, who accompanied the party and conducted
the search, went fumbling about on his hands
and knees in the darker parts of the room; and finally
held up, with an exclamation of delight, a small casket
which he declared was the missing article, and had
been missing ever since Cimon’s visit to the warehouse.
Whereupon the chief of the police showed a warrant for
arresting Cimon. The young man protested, and declared
that he saw the Cretan slyly whip the casket out
of the bosom of his own tunic. But the older man<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_280" id="Page_280">[280]</a></span>
thought that the police were right in claiming that they
had no option in the case—he would go with them without
resistance, and his friend could take such measures
on the morrow for his relief as he might find best. So
he went off with the party, leaving the young man standing
at the gate.</p>

<p>But this party had scarcely disappeared, when a band
of Roman soldiers came up and surrounded Aleph. “Are
you Aleph, the Chaldean?” demanded the leader.</p>

<p>“So I am called,” said the young man.</p>

<p>“Then we have been sent to arrest you.”</p>

<p>“For what?” demanded Aleph.</p>

<p>“For assault and battery here last night; and as a
suspected enemy of the emperor.”</p>

<p>“Show me your warrant,” demanded the young man.</p>

<p>The leader produced a document bearing what purported
to be the seal and signature of the governor. “Is
this document genuine?” said Aleph to the landlord,
who was standing by. The landlord looked at the paper
and nodded.</p>

<p>“Then I will go with you,” said the young man
calmly. “But may I not first communicate my situation
to my friends, that they may have an opportunity to
set me right with the authorities?”</p>

<p>“We were not authorized to allow delay for any
purpose.”</p>

<p>“You will have to delay,” said Aleph, “for the purpose
of hearing and allowing these by-standers” (several
of the guests of the khan had by this time come up)
“to hear me declare that I am innocent of the charges
brought against me, and can prove as much, opportunity
being given me.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_281" id="Page_281">[281]</a></span></p>

<p>A soldier approached to bind him. Aleph motioned
him away with his cane. “I have said that I will go
with you. I now say that I will go with you without
attempting to escape while going, provided you leave me
free and in possession of this cane. Otherwise the man
who approaches me does so at his peril.”</p>

<p>After some consultation his demand was granted; and
he went off quietly with the party, saying to the landlord
as he went, “You can at least tell what you have
seen and heard.”</p>

<p>Such was the account given to Seti. He remained
merely to ask a simple question: “Could there be any
doubt as to the party being real Roman soldiers?” The
landlord thought not: they had the equipment of Roman
soldiers; and, besides, their bearing and step together
were professional.</p>

<p>The high-priest hastened back to the Serapeum, assumed
his pontifical robes, summoned a large train of
servants, and proceeded in his official chariot, drawn
by four white mules, to the Roman headquarters in
Bruchium. Arrived at the palace of the governor, a
herald stepped before the gate, blew a trumpet, and
cried: “Seti of the Serapeum, high-priest of Egypt
and metropolitan, desires audience of Avilleus Flaccus,
Proprætor and Legate of Cæsar and Governor of
Egypt.”</p>

<p>In a few moments the gates were thrown open, and
the whole party entered a large court, where, at the foot
of a flight of marble steps, Seti alighted and was conducted
by an obsequious usher into the audience-room
and presence of the Roman governor.</p>

<p>Seti was dignified and formal; coolly saluting his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_282" id="Page_282">[282]</a></span>
excellency with all the usual formalities, but not a jot
beyond. On the other hand, Flaccus, an ordinary man
to look at but wearing the extraordinary toga permitted
to the imperial representative, was exceedingly demonstrative
and deferential in welcoming his illustrious visitor.
He seemed to feel that, belonging only to the
Equestrian Order and with no ancestors save those
whose names had been written with water and in water,
he was socially far from being equal to the freezingly cold
and stately Egyptian pontiff whose sires had reigned in
palaces and temples before Rome was founded.</p>

<p>Seti cut short the ceremonial. Would the governor
be good enough to say whether he had given an order for
the arrest of a regularly enrolled member of the University,
an inmate of the Serapeum, and a particular friend
of himself and the Alabarch Alexander?</p>

<p>Flaccus appeared to consult his memory. He did not
remember to have given any such order.</p>

<p>“An order to arrest one Aleph, the Chaldean, as a
disturber of the public peace and a suspected enemy of
the emperor?” suggested Seti.</p>

<p>No, he did not think that he could have given such
an order.</p>

<p>“An order executed last evening by a company of
Roman soldiers?” continued the priest in the same icy
tone.</p>

<p>“Certainly not.”</p>

<p>“I am glad to hear it, and to have your authority for
denying the report that is getting abroad. It may also
be for your interest to deny it personally as you have
opportunity; for the young man in question is a great
favorite, not only with the Alabarch and myself, but<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_283" id="Page_283">[283]</a></span>
also with the young men in the University, who represent
the noblest Roman families and a great interest with
the emperor and the Cæsar.”</p>

<p>“I think,” said Flaccus, with a not very successful
attempt at an arch look, “that I know of somebody who
is likely to have more interest with Germanicus than any
of them.”</p>

<p>“However that may be,” said Seti emphatically, “it
is certain that the young man will have such justice as
our best efforts can secure.”</p>

<p>“What can I do?” said the Roman uneasily.</p>

<p>“I will tell your excellency,” said the Egyptian.
“It is understood in the city that a party of Roman
soldiers, under a written warrant from you, arrested and
carried off, we know not where, a privileged member of
the University, for whom the best vouchers can be found.
But, as I now learn from you, that warrant must have
been forged; and what appeared to be Roman soldiers,
were not such, but other parties in disguise. Now I
would respectfully suggest that you give me and the
other friends of the young man written authority to
search for and rescue him at whatever cost to those who
have carried him off. This will answer our purpose,
and at the same time serve to defend you from the suspicions
of the people.”</p>

<p>Flaccus hesitated, bit his lip, twirled a gold badge
that hung from his neck, looked at every object in the
room save Seti. Seti looked at nothing save him.</p>

<p>The priest rose to go. “Time is of great consequence
to me this morning. Am I to understand that your
excellency declines to authorize me in writing to rescue
from robbers and murderers a young man for whom the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_284" id="Page_284">[284]</a></span>
Alabarch and myself, as well as the University at large,
offer to stand vouchers?”</p>

<p>“I do not see why you need a written authorization
from me,” said Flaccus, beginning to sharpen a reed.</p>

<p>“I did not say that we need such a document. <em>You</em>
need to give it.” He said this last in a low but a very
distinct and measured tone of voice.</p>

<p>“Well, I will give it,” said the governor with sudden
decision—“if it will oblige you and your friends.”</p>

<p>“It <em>will</em> oblige us,” said Seti; and in a few moments
he took punctilious leave with the desired document in
his possession.</p>

<p>He returned at once to the Serapeum. Resuming his
ordinary dress, he proceeded to the lecture room, where,
as yet, he found only two or three students, among whom
was Publius Cornelius. He beckoned them to him, and
asked such co-operation as they could give in a matter he
was about to bring before the whole class. Shortly they
came pouring in, rather obstreperously, I fear, as college
boys have been wont to do from the beginning; but as
soon as they set eyes on their teacher there was a profound
hush; for they saw at once that something unusual
had happened—that the Seti they had hitherto known
had given place to quite a different Seti and a much
younger man. All the old dignity and authority were in
his face and bearing; but somehow there had come into
the old look a roused and forceful expression such as a
crisis might be expected to call out in a young man
largely endowed both as a man of thought and action.
Calm, watchful, mindful of all that is passing and likely
to pass, prepared to throw his whole force into action at
a moment’s warning. All the students were in a hush of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_285" id="Page_285">[285]</a></span>
expectation as they saw the new man sitting on the
old bema.</p>

<p>He began with saying that he had no lecture for them
that morning. But he had something better than a
lecture—an opportunity for a good action. He then concisely
and simply narrated his morning experiences, and
held up the document he had obtained from Flaccus.
Perhaps the young man had been killed. Perhaps he
was only imprisoned in some out-of-the-way place. It
was for his friends to find out the facts as soon as possible.
He knew of none who could do as prompt and good service
in the matter as the generous-minded fellow-students of
the extraordinary young man who had so commended
himself to their admiration. Would they undertake it?</p>

<p>The response was instantaneous. Many sprang to
their feet, with flushed faces and hot, indignant words.</p>

<p>“A conspiracy!” cried one.</p>

<p>“An insult to the University,” cried another. Some
called out “<i>Draco</i>” interrogatively; and others, of the
bolder and more highly connected of the Romans, among
whom was Publius Cornelius, shook their fists significantly
in the direction of the Cæsareum. One thing was
evident to the watchful eye of Seti—that there would be
no lack of sympathetic readiness on the part of the Serapeum
to act as he wished. What did he wish?</p>

<p>This was brought out by Cornelius, who declared that
they were all of one mind to further any plan that their
venerable instructor might have to propose; and moved
that a committee be appointed to confer with him as to
what had best be done. He also proposed that this committee
should secure the co-operation of the Museum,
which he had no doubt would be enthusiastically given.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_286" id="Page_286">[286]</a></span></p>

<p>“Besides,” he added, as he repeated his emphatic
gesture toward the north-east, “the Museum is nearer
than ourselves to the sources of this mischief and can
explore them better.”</p>

<p>A committee was appointed—including Cornelius.
These gathered about Seti. His plan was that some
students should find out whether Draco and the son of
Flaccus were present in the city all the last night—that
others should find out whether any soldiers were then
absent from their quarters, and if so to whose force they
belonged—that still others should watch the gates and
harbors for their return and note the time and direction
of it—that still others should rummage the streets, especially
in the neighborhood of the khan Rachotis, for some
who had observed the party, noticed the direction they
took, perhaps witnessed an embarkation. The students
interested were so many, they could, by properly distributing
themselves, make all these inquiries at once. No time
should be lost. Let them report to him.</p>

<p>Feeling sure that the young men would need no further
impulse, the priest left them, and, stopping at his room for
the parcel which Cimon had put in his hands, proceeded to
the office of Alexander’s legal adviser. This was in a
wing of the extensive palace of the great banker whose
affairs furnished the greater part of the business of the
lawyer. The man was both a Roman and a Greek—his
father being from Tusculum, and his mother from
Athens. He possessed in a remarkable degree the mental
characteristics of both nations—the practical and resolute
character of the one, and the acuteness and subtlety
of the other. To a profound knowledge of Roman law,
especially as applied in the provinces, he added a familiar<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_287" id="Page_287">[287]</a></span>
acquaintance with the usages of Alexandria as a business
community—having lived in the city from childhood.
Alexander early discovered his abilities, and by degrees
made him a confidential adviser in legal matters, especially
after he became a proselyte and attached himself to
the Diapleuston.</p>

<p>Marcus Piso was not much of a man to look at—at the
first look. Small, slender, somewhat stooping, no longer
young—it was necessary to be with him for a time and
watch his face and manner—his keen eye and protuberant
brow—as he dispatched business with one and another.
Then he inspired confidence both as to his ability and
integrity. Then one said, “Alexander is not mistaken
in his man.”</p>

<p>The little man did <em>not</em> show to advantage as he rose
to receive his imposing visitor. But, what was better
under the circumstances, he at once conducted Seti to an
inner office and listened with all his ears, and eyes too, to
a brief account of our friends, of what had just transpired,
and of the measures taken for the discovery of Aleph.</p>

<p>“I tell you these facts,” said Seti, “to interest you as
much as possible in these men whom the Alabarch and
myself intend to support and befriend to the utmost of
our power.”</p>

<p>“I have been strongly interested in them ever since
the affair at the Diapleuston, which I happened to witness;
and my thoughts were running on them when you
came in; for news of the arrest of Cimon for theft had
just reached me.”</p>

<p>“As if a man having credit with Alexander to the
amount of 200,000 gold staters was likely to pilfer! No,
the charge and the arrest were gotten up to prevent or<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_288" id="Page_288">[288]</a></span>
discredit an impending suit by Cimon against Malus.
And Aleph has been killed, or spirited away, partly to
aid the same purpose, and partly to gratify the malice of
certain others whose names you can guess.”</p>

<p>Seti then produced Cimon’s parcel, and continued:
“I am told that you will find in this parcel all needful
particulars in regard to the proposed suit against Malus.
Please examine it at once and if you find it warrants legal
proceedings institute them without delay. Of course
Malus is strongly intrenched and will fight to the death;
but we will back you with all our forces. I am sure that
I speak for Alexander as well as for myself. Meanwhile,
whatever you can do to cancel or relieve the imprisonment
of Cimon, please do. The case of the young man I will
look after myself.”</p>

<p>Seti’s next visit was to Rachel—not by way of the
street, but by a private door in the inner office of the
advocate, by which he was accustomed to communicate
with the banker. He found his granddaughter in Miriam’s
room. And he saw at once, in the looks of the two
women, that the evil news had preceded him. Miriam
looked totally exhausted, and lay on her bed feebly
moaning, with closed eyes; her hand held by Rachel.
As to Rachel herself, Seti was struck by the change that
had taken place. A touch of mingled amazement and
suffering was in her face; but into the profoundly emotional
expression had come “<i lang="la">nescio quod preclarum et
singulare</i>”—a look of self-control that had been fought
for and taken possession of by fire and sword; such a
victory that another like it would be ruin. A certain
new and powerful expression was in every feature.
Lights and shadows of the heroic were hiding in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_289" id="Page_289">[289]</a></span>
depths of her eyes and in the curves of her lips. She
came and sat on a stool at his feet.</p>

<p>“Grandfather, we have tried to wait patiently for
you. You see that we know all. Now tell us what you
have done; for I know you have done something.”</p>

<p>Seti told of his morning movements.</p>

<p>“Do you think it possible that they have <em>killed</em>
him?” she asked with awe in her voice and white
lips.</p>

<p>“Sometimes I think not; and yet it would be hard
to give my reasons. His enemies are capable of any
crime. Perhaps the only ground of my opinion or feeling
that he has not been killed is the wonderful resources,
both of body and mind, which he has for self-protection.
I have never seen a young man with such powers, and
such a complete and never-failing mastery of them. He
is a natural prince and hero, and somehow and somewhere
has had a training to match. He is just the man
for great and desperate situations. He is an empire in
himself. I hardly wonder at Cornelius, who says of him
that he has in his veins the blood of the immortal gods.
Body and soul, he is built like a temple. What Karnac
was, Aleph the Chaldean is.”</p>

<p>“It is even so, grandfather,” murmured the maiden;
and she buried her burning face in her hands.</p>

<p>“This gives me hope,” continued Seti. “Besides,
as I have told you, he refused to be bound or to give up
his staff; and the same wariness that led him to retain
this means of defense would be apt to keep him on his
guard against assault. Yes, such a great and resourceful
nature would not be killed easily.”</p>

<p>“Say <em>not at all</em>, grandfather. Let us not <em>imagine</em><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_290" id="Page_290">[290]</a></span>
such a thing, lest it take the heart out of us,” and she
shuddered.</p>

<p>Seti looked at her keenly for a moment. She suddenly
drew herself up as she sat, tossed away with both hands
the heavy tresses that had fallen over her face, and looked
up with wide-open eyes into his. He laid his hand tenderly
on her head, and sighed before saying:</p>

<p>“It is as you say. We must hope for the best if we
would escape the worst. Aleph the Chaldean <em>is</em> a living
prisoner somewhere, and we must find and release him
as soon as possible. So I must go.”</p>

<p>“Take Miriam and me as active, though invisible,
partners in this matter, dear grandfather,” pleaded
Rachel. “It is necessary for us if not for you. We cannot
sit here and wait, and wait, with folded hands till
somebody brings us word of what others are doing, or
trying to do. It would kill us. We have kept ourselves
alive thus far only by praying: now we must have something
to do to help our praying. You see how the case
stands with me—it is a <em>necessity</em>.”</p>

<p>“But what can you do?”</p>

<p>“We can at least <em>try</em> to do in some womanly ways.
This will be a relief to us. You are working by means
of the famous University; perhaps we can work quite as
effectively by a humbler class of agents. At least we can
<em>try</em>: and our thinking and planning may save us if they
do not save him. In my father’s absence I want your
approval.”</p>

<p>“I think you are right,” said the priest slowly. “So
be it, then. It may be that your womanly devisings
will be the first to penetrate the mystery. I shall not
complain if it prove so.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_291" id="Page_291">[291]</a></span></p>

<p>Seti kissed her and departed, saying to himself, “Some
trees are killed by decapitation, but this tree becomes
thriftier and fairer than ever.”</p>

<p><em>Was</em> it decapitation? Well, if it was not that, it was
something that marvellously resembled it. Seti was an
experienced man, and his faculty of insight was great:
and I would sooner take his judgment in the matter than
that of most. He thought the trial that had befallen his
granddaughter terribly severe. I think the same. I
should be sorry to have that stroke repeated. Nobly as
the first blow has been borne, I could not answer for
a second. There are limits to successful pruning. A
plant may be decapitated once too often. Seti thought
so too, and he carried away with him a greater burden
than he brought; for now he understood that the question
was no longer how to save Aleph, but how to save
Aleph and Rachel.</p>

<p>The Egyptian went home praying—praying to <i>Amun
Re</i>. An able lawyer, an enthusiastic University, a resourceful
high-priest armed with an official document,
were all very well in their place; but they needed presiding
over and empowering by the Supernatural. Would
He do it? In the course of his long observation, Seti
had known some striking cases of poetical justice in
human affairs. The wicked had been taken in their own
toils. Into the pits they had dug for their neighbors they
had fallen themselves. But it was often otherwise. The
righteous had fallen before the wicked. Craft and power
and powerful money had proved too mighty for goodness
and justice. If good causes had always thrived, the
Romans would not be in Egypt, nor Flaccus in the
Cæsareum, nor Malus in the grandest warehouse of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_292" id="Page_292">[292]</a></span>
Emporium Street. So who can tell what <i>Amun Re</i> will
do? And yet prayer is the breath of the nations and the
ages. Nature herself says, <i>Let us pray</i>.</p>

<p>So the thoughts of Seti prayed, and prayed mightily,
as he bent his steps to the Serapeum.</p>

<p>Rachel went and sat by the bedside, in long
silence. At length she began unconsciously to
think aloud—at first slowly and with long pauses; then
more rapidly.</p>

<p>“They have <em>not</em> killed him. Then they have taken
him out of the city to confine him somewhere.... The
shortest and least embarrassed way out of the city would
be by the gate of the Moon to Mareotis.... Here boat
would be taken. Where would it go? There is no place
where a prisoner could be confined on the islands of the
lake or on the southern shore—none in the pleasure-villas
on the banks of the canal connecting the lake with the
Nile—none on the Nile itself till one comes to the fortress
that once belonged to the family of Seti, but now
is in possession of the Roman governor. I have it—there
<em>are</em> dungeons there, and Sextus Flaccus has access to
them, and they are well away from observation. <em>That</em> is
the place where they have carried him.”</p>

<p>Her face flushed, and her eyes flashed with sudden
decision. “Grandfather’s way may be sure, but it is
slow; and by the time he finds his way up the Nile to
the Setian stronghold it may be too late. I will leap to
a conclusion.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_296" id="Page_296">[296]</a></span></p>

<p>She at once summoned all the domestics of the household.
Did any of them know of a traveling merchant,
accustomed to carry his wares from house to house along
the east bank of the Nile? Several knew of such a person.
Was he a Jew? Was he of the Diapleuston? Was
he quick-witted and prudent? Was he now in the city?
Receiving an affirmative answer to all these questions,
she at once dispatched a man who professed to know
where the peddler could be found, to bring him without
delay.</p>

<p>In less than an hour her messenger returned with the
very peddler whose acquaintance we made in the first
chapter of this narrative. She looked at him narrowly.
He was not an attractive object—what with his poor
clothes, his unkempt hair, and his excessive obsequiousness.
But he did look shrewd and to a degree reliable.
At all events she must try him. So she told him that
she had heard a favorable account of his intelligence and
discretion; that she wanted to employ such a man to go
up the Nile as far as the Setian palace on a confidential
mission. She wished to find out, without the knowledge
of any armed force that might be there, whether a young
man is held in confinement in the palace. And she
thought that, if he would furnish himself with such a
pack of goods as seemed most likely to attract the servants
and others about the premises, he might incidentally
contrive to get from them the desired information.
She would furnish the goods, and, besides, reward him
richly for the service.</p>

<p>“Is the young man tall and marvelously well proportioned?”
inquired the Jew.</p>

<p>“He is.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_297" id="Page_297">[297]</a></span></p>

<p>“Has he the face of Moses, and the bearing of a
king?”</p>

<p>“So it is said.”</p>

<p>“Is it not he who on the last Sabbath defended our
synagogue from sacrilege?”</p>

<p>“It is.”</p>

<p>“Then,” said the peddler, “I will do what the lady
asks of me—not for her rewards, though Father Abraham
knows that I am poor enough. I will do it for the
young man’s sake, who can beat the heathen at their own
weapons. I can beat them in trade; but it is a satisfaction
to me to see them beaten after another fashion.”</p>

<p>“Have you ever been at the palace?” inquired
Rachel.</p>

<p>“Often, in the way of trade. An old Egyptian and
his wife, a Jewess, keep the place when the governor is
not there, and are employed about the premises in some
way at all times.”</p>

<p>“Here is a purse of gold. Make up your pack as
attractive to these people as possible. Stay with them
as long as you can. Be ingenious. Keep eyes and ears
open. Spare no money nor promises that will help your
object. I will see that your promises are fulfilled. Take
the first boat going south; be put ashore at a little distance
from the palace; then do the best an ingenious
man can, to find out whether Aleph, the Chaldean, is
confined there, and, if so, how he may be released. Return
or send as soon as possible. But stop——”</p>

<p>She went to a desk, and wrote on a small sheet of
papyrus as follows: “Your friends have found you.
You shall have help soon.—R.”</p>

<p>She handed the paper to the Jew, saying, “Should<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_298" id="Page_298">[298]</a></span>
you find him, perhaps you may be able to get this to
him.”</p>

<p>The man hastened away. What should she do now,
and during the days that might pass before she could
hope to hear from the peddler? To sit still and wait,
she felt to be impossible. Was there anything more she
could be doing to keep her heart from preying on itself?
She asked the question of Miriam as well as of herself.</p>

<p>Miriam had quickened and strengthened bodily under
the rousing of thought and care for one outside of herself,
and was sitting up thoughtfully in her bed. Yes,
she thought that something further might be done. She
doubted whether the students would be as good at getting
information from the town-people as would some
others. The frequent broils and jealousies between the
two classes would put inquirers at a disadvantage. And,
then, the people who would be most likely to notice the
abduction, because most likely to be abroad in the evening,
would be the humbler classes, whose homes had
little to attract them. The humble stall-keepers; the
daily workmen hanging about the street-corners; the
street-boys, brimful of curiosity, afraid of nothing, ready
to run after anything unusual; the watermen, that wait
for jobs at the gate of the Moon or on the lake-wharves,
would be more likely to notice and more free to speak of,
to people of their own class, the passing of the soldiers.</p>

<p>“Suppose we ask the servants,” said she, “whether
they know any of their own class living on the route from
the khan to the Gate—any workmen, or watermen, or
waifs likely to have been in that neighborhood waiting for
what might turn up. If they themselves do not know of
any such, they will be likely to know some who do; and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_299" id="Page_299">[299]</a></span>
so inquiries may be set in motion through all the humbler
classes. Give the servants a holiday—several holidays, if
necessary. We can dispense with them. I feel a return
of my old vigor—the God of Israel be praised!” and, to
the surprise of Rachel, the woman drew herself from the
bed into a chair that stood by the side of it.</p>

<p>Rachel was too much absorbed in her object and plans
to spend any time in speculating on that mysterious connection
of the soul with the body that enables the former
in its roused state to infuse its own healthy vigor into
the latter. But she was glad that the pressure of circumstances
had so opportunely transformed the helpless
into a helper, and only begged her not to exert herself
too much, as she carefully drew the wraps about her.</p>

<p>Rachel welcomed the suggestions of Miriam; and
soon the many servants of that large household were
abroad seeking for information, or seeking those who
could seek it better than themselves.</p>

<p>Toward the close of the day Seti appeared to report that
Sextus Flaccus had been found to have been in the city
all the previous night, and that, apparently, no soldiers
had been absent from their quarters. But Draco had
disappeared from early in the evening, and had been
traced to Mareotis—this seemed to Rachel a particle of
light. No reports as yet from the students watching the
gates and harbors, or from those seeking traces within
the city. Rachel told Seti of the supplementary measures
she had taken for getting information within the
city, but she said nothing of the peddler and his expedition.
I hardly know why. Perhaps it was because she
thought the womanly logic of the movement would not
commend itself to a philosopher.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_300" id="Page_300">[300]</a></span></p>

<p>The next morning Miriam was still better—indeed
almost seemed to forget in her new object of absorbing
interest that she was an invalid at all. As yet the servants
had made no report; having come in late the
night before and gone out again before light in the
morning. Inactive waiting is an uneasy business at the
best; so Rachel determined to have as little of it as possible.
She sent off a servant with a basket of provisions
to the house of the peddler with instructions to learn at
what hour he left the city and in what sort of craft; for
there was almost as much difference then as now in the
speed of vessels. She found that the active man, within
an hour from the time he left her, had managed to provide
himself with a more attractive pack than he had
ever before carried, and to get on board a well-appointed
merchant vessel just starting southward with a fair wind
and not a few oars. This was some comfort. She
prayed that the wind might follow fast, and that the
rowers might be able and willing at their toil.</p>

<p>In the course of the day another small comfort (small
and transient like the scarcely perceptible shade of greenness
that sometimes comes even in the heart of winter,
for a few hours, to some sunny nook and then retreats as
fast as it came) came with some scraps of information
brought in by the servants. They reported that the company
of soldiers had been noticed at different points in
the Egyptian quarter; and, on comparing these points,
the women saw that they meant a movement toward the
gate of the Moon. This was a much-needed encouragement
to Seti, who came in the evening to say that the
students had as yet been able to draw no information
from the people whatever. They seemed to regard all<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_301" id="Page_301">[301]</a></span>
the inquiries with suspicion, as if they meant some College
prank against which their best refuge was silence.
What so many students wanted to know they would do
well to conceal. So the young men spoke to deaf ears
and silent tongues. Still they would not discontinue
their inquiries. They hoped that all their ravens would
not come home to roost.</p>

<p>The next day added considerably to the stock of information.
Several street-boys who were hanging about the
gate and wharves on the night in question had been ferreted
out in their various dens by the servants, and agreed
that a company of soldiers with a prisoner passed through
the gate while they were there, and took boat to a
larger craft lying out some little distance in the lake. On
their part the students had discovered that the pleasure-galley
of the Flacci had been absent from its station ever
since the same evening, and had been seen by a waterman
steering toward the canal and the Nile. Rachel was now
so satisfied that her first movement was a wise one that
she told Seti of it. He was glad that so time-saving a
measure had been adopted; and returned to inform the
students that such traces had been discovered that they
need no longer continue their inquiries in the city, but
should hold themselves in readiness to co-operate in
another movement that might be necessary. He now felt
quite sure that the soldiers employed in the abduction
were <em>discharged</em> soldiers—men who from age and other
reasons were no longer in active service—of whom there
were not a few in the city quite ready to lend themselves
to the purposes and the pay of such a man as Sextus
Flaccus.</p>

<p>Immersed in her cares for Aleph, Rachel had neglected<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_302" id="Page_302">[302]</a></span>
till to-day to inquire about Cimon and his affairs.
For this she blamed herself roundly. But she was glad
to learn that her father’s solicitor had found Cimon’s
papers very complete as against Malus, had formally instituted
a suit, had been able as Cimon’s official advocate to
procure admittance to him and arrange for his comfort
till his trial should come off, that the chief clerk of Malus,
who had been discharged by him as soon as he learned
how liberal of business information he had been to
Cimon, had come to him with valuable evidence. Three
suits were to come off in the following order—(1) The
suit of Malus against Shaphan and Nathan, (2) the suit of
Malus against Cimon, (3) the suit of Cimon against Malus.
Marcus Piso was more than satisfied with this order;
for he felt that the first two trials would throw much
damaging light on the character and operations of Malus
and prepare the way for the success of Cimon’s suit
against him.</p>

<p>“But then those Roman courts! Who could guarantee
their equity! Would not the Flaccan influence be
supreme in them and in favor of the supreme criminal
in whose misdeeds it had long participated! The Most
High only knows! If possible, we must make the right
of the case so plain that neither court nor government
can go against it without the whole people crying shame
on them. And this I am more and more inclined to
think can be done.” ... So encouraged Marcus Piso.
At the same time, with a shadow on his face, he admitted
that the devil was strong.</p>

<p>The next day was the Sabbath. The family of Alexander
were very strict in their observance of the day, but
not so unreasonably strict as to refuse works of necessity<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_303" id="Page_303">[303]</a></span>
and mercy. Miriam (now wonderfully improved) and
Rachel would not have hesitated to plan and do, to any
extent, in so urgent a case as that of Aleph if they could
have seen opportunity. But, until they should hear from
the peddler, what more could be done? Certainly nothing
but praying. So they gave themselves wholly to this
mighty form of working. The God of Israel, so pitiful
and so powerful, and who had said, “Call upon me in
the day of trouble and I will deliver thee,” was invoked
that day with an energy and whole-heartedness that
seemed bound to cross all the spaces and make its way to
the very foothold of the Throne. Till the public services
at the Diapleuston, the women were scarcely off their
knees for a moment.</p>

<p>At the synagogue, to her surprise, Rachel found Seti
seated where Cimon and Aleph had been placed on the
last Sabbath. She went and sat down by him for a few
moments, placing her hand in his; and then went to her
own place. The selections from the Law and the Prophets
by her uncle Philo, as well as his remarks that followed,
seemed to her to have a most positive though veiled reference
to the case, which she felt was by this time weighting
all their minds with its certainties and uncertainties.
She felt it good to be there. There was something soothing
and supporting in the sympathetic atmosphere. And
so she lingered after the conclusion of the services.</p>

<p>While thus lingering, she noticed a woman of the
humbler class trying to make her way somewhat impatiently
toward her through the slow-moving crowd. As
soon as she came near enough the woman thrust into her
hand a paper rudely folded and at once passed on with
the rest of the retiring congregation. Rachel opened the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_304" id="Page_304">[304]</a></span>
paper at once, and with some difficulty deciphered the
following:</p>

<p>“He is here. They are trying to starve him. I can
prevent that for a little; but the custodes will take no
decisive step till they have had my promises in your
behalf confirmed by your own lips.”</p>

<p>When she had finished reading the scrawl she found
Seti standing by her side and drawing her arm within
his. It was timely. Unsupported she might have fallen.
It was a flash of light that she had longed for, but it had
in it something of the threat and terribleness of a flash of
lightning. It revealed, but it revealed an urgent danger.
Her agitation remained voiceless till they had reached
home and Seti had read the letter. It lifted a cloud from
his brow. Now they knew that Aleph was still alive,
knew where to find him, could make some reasonable plan
for his rescue. He congratulated her. Early to-morrow
they would go up the river in the galley of Alexander,
well-equipped with resolute men. Perhaps he would ask
some of the students to follow at a distance in another
galley. They might not be needed; but it was well to
overlap emergencies with our provisions. At all events,
the young men would be gratified—and they deserved to
be. He had never thought so well of young men since he
was a young man himself. Especially of Cornelius. Such
unselfish enthusiasm and untiring effort in behalf of a
confessed superior, such hearty use of his influence and
leadership to further all plans in aid of Aleph—why,
they spoke almost as loudly for Rome as Tiberius and
the Flacci did against it!</p>

<p>The clouds on the horizon had begun to redden.
Was it from the rising or the setting sun? Neither Seti<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_305" id="Page_305">[305]</a></span>
nor Rachel could tell; for they did not know the east
and west of Providence. It was indeed something to
have found that Aleph was still living (a fact which they
had compelled themselves to assume, but which phantoms
with mocking faces and whispering voices were all the
while challenging at both ears); also that he was at the
Setian palace. Now they could localize and focalize their
exertions in his behalf. This was at first a very sensible
relief. But, in finding these facts, they had also found
that their friend was in the hands of a body of desperadoes
who were seeking his life. Might they not succeed
before the swiftest help could reach him? Perhaps they
had succeeded already. That single poor peddler was a
mighty thin partition between life and death. So the
clouds which had thinned away somewhat soon thickened
up again into the old blackness. Through the live-long
night the waves of hope and fear alternately beat on the
vexed strands whose names were Seti and Rachel.</p>

<p>The wear and tear of such times are very great on
some people. A single night has been known to bow a
form as stately as Seti’s—to blanch tresses as young and
beautiful as Rachel’s. But let us hope the best for both
sufferers. One of them is strong in youth, the other is
strong in age. Neither will be easily overborne. Neither
is a stretch of low-lying sands, easily loosened and carried
out to sea in rough weather. Both are highlands,
fronted and ribbed with rocks for the sea to dash and
roar upon—rocky convictions of the supernatural, rocky
faith in a divine government, rocky <i lang="la">mens conscia recti</i>.
In this I find some comfort. At the same time I know
that even rock-bound coasts sometimes suffer heavily in a
wild time. Have I not walked on such a coast the day<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_306" id="Page_306">[306]</a></span>
after the storm has been hurling its battalions upon it
and found it ragged and torn and strewn with ruins—the
battle-field of yesterday? And I am far from saying but
that this may be just the condition in which the sore
winds and waves of their trial may leave Seti and Rachel.
We must be prepared for the worst while we hope the
best. Should the worst come, no heart will be sorer than
mine.</p>

<h3>XIV.<br />
<span class="smaller">THE ARGONAUTS.</span></h3>

<p>Early the next morning the pinnace of Alexander
was moving toward the Nile as fast as eight strong
oarsmen and a fair breeze could carry it. Under a silken
awning in the stern sat Seti and Rachel: while at some
distance a few stout male servants in holiday attire leaned
over the bulwarks, watching the water ripple away from
the shapely sides, listening to the low monotonous stroke-song
of the rowers as they rhythmically struck the waters,
and occasionally talking together in a low tone.</p>

<p>Seemingly it was a holiday excursion—nothing more.
The whole aspect of things on board that delicate butterfly
of a vessel, including the lovely maiden in her rich
robes, with her harp standing by her side, was that of a
pleasure party. No one looking from shore or passing
vessel would have thought that such a festival barge with
its luxurious and dainty furnishings and daintier mistress
was heavily weighted with anxious thoughts of peril
and conflict.</p>

<p>To Rachel, her surroundings, from the cloudless sky
and wooing breeze to the costly and delicate sea-chariot
on which she was borne, seemed almost so many mockeries.
Her real sky was full of clouds, her real wind was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_310" id="Page_310">[310]</a></span>
the breath of storms, and the real galley on which her
spirit was sailing was a war ship full of swords and spears
and faces threatening battle. She found it very hard to
cover her anxieties with the serene face and manner which
she felt the situation demanded. So she kept the servants
as far from her as possible, that their prying eyes
and ears might not play too successfully on herself and
Seti.</p>

<p>They were hardly well afloat before Seti began to unfold
his plan of proceeding.</p>

<p>“It is very important,” said he, “that we implicate
the Flacci, both father and son, as little as possible in
this affair. The father, bad as he is, probably has nothing
to do with the abduction; and so ought not to suffer
on account of it. The guilty party is Sextus; who, having
access to his father’s official seal and blank forms,
forged the warrant for the arrest, and then employed
some dissolute companions of his among the discharged
Roman soldiers to execute the warrant. These having
no duties in the city have not yet returned, and so the
watch of the students for them has been in vain. Sextus
is the great criminal in the case and deserves exposure.
But, if we so manage the matter as to expose him both to
his mortified father and the public, we shall be sure so to
exasperate both of them as to throw their whole influence,
under one pretext or another, against us in the impending
suit against Malus. And that would be a very serious
matter. So we must try to rescue Aleph as quietly
as possible—in some way that does not direct public suspicion
toward the Flacci at all. If we should appear before
the castle of the governor with a sufficient force to
back us, and demand the prisoner, the whole affair would<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_311" id="Page_311">[311]</a></span>
at once go abroad to the four winds, and cry <span class="smcap">Flaccus</span> in
every ear from Pharos to the Cataracts: besides, the garrison
would probably deny having the prisoner, and contrive
some way of disposing of him before we could effect
an entrance. So the best way for us is to persuade the
custodes to give Aleph the means of making his own escape;
and we can be near to receive him and carry him
quietly back to the city—saying nothing as to where he
was found and how rescued. If this plan fails we must,
of course, resort to rougher methods.”</p>

<p>“Do you think,” inquired the maiden, “that Aleph
would have submitted so quietly to the arrest had he not
supposed it made by the proper authorities?”</p>

<p>“Certainly not. He yielded to what he supposed to
be the government of the country in which for the time
being he was living.”</p>

<p>“In that case, if he were assured that the arrest was
pronounced unwarranted by the governor, and that he
was expressly allowed to free himself by any means,
would he not be likely to make great efforts to free himself?”</p>

<p>“Doubtless, if opportunity could be found. But
how is he to break down an iron door with his hands, or,
with his hands dig through massive stone walls settled together
and cemented by ages? I know that dungeon
well. It is the strongest in all Egypt. Supreme strength
and courage must have opportunity. Genius must have
some capital of favorable circumstance on which to work.
Even heroes must have ground on which to stand, and
scope for their arms. No, I know the place too well to
think that our young friend, full of resources as he is,
can do anything to help himself till he is at least outside<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_312" id="Page_312">[312]</a></span>
of the dungeon, or till some fitting tools have been introduced
into it.”</p>

<p>“I knew the castle belonged to your ancestors, and is
rightfully yours; but I did not suppose that you knew
anything about the interior.”</p>

<p>“See here!” said the Egyptian, as he drew from the
folds of his robe a parchment discolored by age, and unrolled
it before her. “Here is a plan of the whole
structure, cellars and dungeon included. This has come
down to me through many generations, together with a
written description of every part of the structure; and,
though I have never set foot in it, I think I could find
my way about it without the least difficulty. There has
always lingered in the family a vague faith, be it superstition
or not, that this noblest of the ancient Egyptian
palaces was destined to come back to us some day; and so
the eldest in our line has always made it a point to know
as much about the structure as if he were in actual possession.”</p>

<p>“Explain the plan to me, my dear grandfather. It
may somehow help us in what we have to do. I, too,
would like to be able to thread my way alone over the
whole.”</p>

<p>“Heaven (<em>your</em> Heaven) forbid that you shall have
need to do so. Still, we have leisure for an explanation,
at least in part; and it will be in the way of our family
custom. This line (pointing) represents the high and
massive stone wall that surrounds the whole palace, together
with extensive grounds in the rear. There are
three gates to this all surrounding wall—one in front,
opening on a flight of steps to the river by which the
master and his friends come and go; the others far<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_313" id="Page_313">[313]</a></span>
back on the north and south sides and chiefly used
by servants for communicating with the little hamlets
that lie, one above and the other below the palace.
On the river side of the inclosure rises the quadrangle
of the palace. The front and two connected sides
contain the state and family apartments: the rear is given
up to servants and the various offices belonging to them.
Of course the soldiers are quartered in this last. We will
only study this part now. It is of only a single story
above ground. Right here in the middle is a large room
where doubtless the soldiers eat and drink: to the right
and left of it are their lodging rooms and the kitchens.
Directly under this common and mess room is the single
dungeon of the castle, connected by a flight of steps with
the mess room, and also by another flight through a
heavy iron door with the rear grounds of the castle. One
can reach the dungeon only through the iron door or by
descending from the common mess room. The wine and
provision cellars are to the right and left of the dungeon,
and a narrow passage runs before the whole.”</p>

<p>“Has the dungeon any light and ventilation?” inquired
Rachel anxiously.</p>

<p>“Only through the narrow grated opening in the wall
by which food can be introduced without opening the
door; and the narrow passage before all the vaults is only
dimly lighted by a barred opening near the ceiling at
either end.”</p>

<p>“Would Aleph have light enough to read a note or
this plan of yours?”</p>

<p>“It may be. Such eyes as his can do what mine
could not. I have sometimes thought that they furnished
their own light. But whoever could put a note through<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_314" id="Page_314">[314]</a></span>
that grate could introduce a narrow lamp or taper
also.”</p>

<p>“If a pointed iron bar could be secretly introduced
by the custodes through the grate, would Aleph be able
to pry open the door?”</p>

<p>“Impossible—at least without making so much noise
as to rouse the soldiers.”</p>

<p>“Perhaps they are revellers,” she said reflectively,
“and, having free access to the wine cellars, have frequent
carousals and even stupid drunkenness.”</p>

<p>“Very likely; almost certainly,” Seti exclaimed.
“They are the boon companions of Sextus; and, like
him, will not miss an opportunity of indulgence. If we
can only gain over the custodes, we might so drug their
wine as to stupefy their drunkenness still more, so that
loud noises would not rouse them. This deserves to be
thought of; and, fortunately, I happen to have with me
for another purpose a drug which I think will answer.
But we must not depend on this plan alone. If one expedient
should fail, we must have another to fall back
upon.”</p>

<p>“And what is that?”</p>

<p>“We must persuade the custodes to get possession
of the key of the dungeon. This ought not to be
impossible, if the soldiers have a drunken carouse
every night, as seems to me very likely. But we cannot
be very specific in our plans till we have seen the
peddler and custodes, and know exactly what the situation
is.”</p>

<p>Rachel said nothing more, but pored over the plan of
the palace. At length she drew from a small ivory box
by her side an ink horn and papyrus, and proceeded to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_315" id="Page_315">[315]</a></span>
make a fair copy of the plan—adding some jottings of
explanation as Seti had given them. She then put both
original and copy in his hands. He compared the two,
nodded, and looked at her inquiringly.</p>

<p>“I mean, if it is possible, to get this to him with the
iron bar.”</p>

<p>He silently returned the copy.</p>

<p>Meanwhile the pinnace had been steadily pressing on
its way. It passed through the canal, it turned up the
Nile, it went sweeping by crocodile and hippopotamus
and ibis sporting in the water or sunning by the banks,
it met corn ship, and Roman galley, and Nubian dory,
and skin-raft loaded with brick and stone, and, occasionally,
a pleasure barge freighted to overflowing with the
laughter and song of the young and gay. The peasants
on the banks for a moment stopped work at their trenching
and water wheels to gaze at the beautiful vessel, the
Nautilus of the Nile, and perchance to envy those who
reclined under its snowy wings and silken canopy. Ah,
little did they know what anxieties were aching away at
the heart of all that beauty and costliness! The breeze
toyed with the sails, the waters rippled and gleamed and
laughed away from the decorated prow, the oars rose and
sank in a water-song of their own that kept time with the
low chant of the rowers—there was music of all sorts filtering
through the dreamy air—but under that awning
of silk and purple there was only the music of prayer
and, it may be, of some hope that the Most High would
not allow the wicked to triumph. But prayer was the
chief thing. Much silent planning and resolving was
done during the latter part of the voyage, but there was
more silent praying than either.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_316" id="Page_316">[316]</a></span></p>

<p>“Grandfather, what a comfort and help it is to
pray!” as she turned toward Seti and laid her hand on
his arm.</p>

<p>“I have found it out, my child, though not as soon
as I could wish. But the knowledge will remain.
Straits crowd one toward the Unseen Helper.”</p>

<p>And now the castle was in full view. On a promontory
that curved out boldly into the river, skirted both
above and below by a thick grove of mingled mimosas,
acacias, sycamores, and palms, each of which groves
screened a little bay and hamlet, stood a quadrangular
fortress with its defiant encompassing wall. Rachel drew
her harp toward her and began to play—at first softly and
slowly, and then with a stronger and more rapid hand.
As the pinnace approached the castle she began to accompany
the instrument with her voice: and, when fully in
front, the voice surged up over the promontory in melodious
billows and seemed to envelop it in floods of exultant
song, every word of which was rendered with wonderful
distinctness. It was a chant. It was a chant in the
original tongue of these words from the Book of Daniel.
“Now when he came to the den he cried with a lamentable
voice unto Daniel: and the king spake and said to
Daniel, ‘O Daniel, servant of the living God, is thy God
whom thou servest continually able to deliver thee from
the lions?’”</p>

<p>Again and again the words rose and beat their delicious
music against the castle like an invading army.
Seti narrowly watched the premises as the pinnace glided
by, but saw no sign of life. But as soon as they had gone
a little farther, rounded the promontory, and then silently
veered into the sheltered nook by the hamlet, they saw<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_317" id="Page_317">[317]</a></span>
the peddler on the wharf with his professional pack on his
back.</p>

<p>When the vessel was fairly moored, the man begged to
be allowed to come on board and exhibit his goods, which
he protested were the finest and cheapest to be found outside
of Alexandria. The beautiful lady would certainly
find something she would like among his various stores.
In short, his eloquence was so great that he was at length
allowed to come on board and ostentatiously spread out
his wares about Rachel and Seti.</p>

<p>“Say that he is living,” she almost gasped, though
scarcely above a murmur.</p>

<p>“He is, my lady.”</p>

<p>“Say that food has been given him daily.”</p>

<p>“At least since I came.”</p>

<p>“Now tell us,” she said, with a firmer but still low
voice, “while you slowly display your goods, piece by
piece, what you have done—in as few words as possible.”</p>

<p>“Yes, my lady. I landed at this hamlet, and went
up at once to the south gate of the palace grounds. Here
I found a soldier on guard; but, on making him a small
present, he allowed me to enter and seek my old acquaintances,
the custodes. Fortunately I found them by themselves
in an out-house—the old Egyptian and his much
younger Jewish wife; the latter much the leading partner,
as I had long known. I warmly saluted them as old
friends, hoped they had not forgotten Ezra, assured them
that I had never been so well prepared to give them a
good trade as now; and proceeded to unpack and display
my goods despite their protestations that they did not
want anything, could not afford to buy anything, and
such like nonsense. But I saw that their eyes followed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_318" id="Page_318">[318]</a></span>
me as I spread out article after article, and that they listened
well as I mentioned prices absurdly low.</p>

<p>“‘You must have stolen these things,’ exclaimed the
Jewess. ‘Alas, that a son of Abraham should turn
thief!’</p>

<p>“‘I hardly wonder,’ said I, ‘that you suspect my
honesty; for, as you so plainly see, these goods are worth
many times what I ask for them. How then does it
happen that I can honestly offer them so low? I will tell
you. I have a very liberal friend—no less a person than
the lady Rachel, daughter of the great banker Alexander;
and she pities me and other poor children of our people;
and it is she who makes it possible for me to let you have
the goods at so low a figure. Our father Abraham knows
that I could not do it otherwise.’</p>

<p>“As soon as I mentioned your name, I saw at once that
I had touched the right chord. I have since found that
she came from Alexandria, where her family in time of
sickness and poverty had received much help from your
family. ‘The God of our fathers bless the pitiful and
gracious lady,’ she exclaimed. ‘Many a time has she
helped me and mine.’</p>

<p>“‘And is she not the granddaughter of Seti—the high-priest
and head of my race?’ inquired the Egyptian husband.</p>

<p>“‘To be sure she is,’ I exclaimed, ‘the worthy child
of both Egypt and Israel—and I will tell you a secret (I
sank my voice very low and looked cautiously about). I
can tell you of a way in which you can greatly oblige
these great friends of ours and get as many of these
goods as you would like for just nothing—absolutely
nothing.’</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_319" id="Page_319">[319]</a></span></p>

<p>“Their eyes opened wider and began to glisten. They
drew themselves closer to me.</p>

<p>“‘Look you,’ said I, ‘there has been in the dungeon
of this castle for the last few days a young man who is a
special friend of Seti and Alexander. He was arrested
without right, and spirited away from Alexandria in the
night, and brought here by a company of men appearing
as Roman soldiers.’</p>

<p>“Thrown off her guard, the Jewess exclaimed, ‘How
did you come to know this?’</p>

<p>“‘No matter,’ said I, ‘it is enough that I <em>do</em> know
it; and know further that if you would oblige Seti and
Alexander, who have such claims on you, as well as wonderfully
advantage yourselves, you have now an opportunity.
If you will help them in this matter, they can and
will do great things for you. It is the opportunity of a
life-time.’</p>

<p>“‘But what can we do?’ exclaimed both custodes at
once.</p>

<p>“‘I will tell you. But first tell me whether you have
seen that goodly young man with your own eyes, and
know him to have been safe and sound when he was put
into the dungeon.’</p>

<p>“‘So he seemed by the torch-light,’ said the Jewess.
‘A goodly young man, you may well say. I never saw
one half so goodly. He stood like a king among his
slaves, with his great staff for a sceptre. The soldiers
seemed almost as much afraid of his eye as of his staff,
and plainly felt relieved when the key was turned upon
him.’</p>

<p>“‘Has he had food and drink since then?’ I
asked.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_320" id="Page_320">[320]</a></span></p>

<p>“They hesitated; and the woman looked in a troubled
way at her husband.</p>

<p>“‘Now, by all the patriarchs,’ cried I in great excitement,
‘have they been starving this friend of Seti and
Alexander all these days, and you doing nothing to help
him?’</p>

<p>“‘Not so,’ she hastened to exclaim. ‘We thought
we could not let the young man perish; and as soon as
we found out that no food of any kind was being given
him we managed to introduce some secretly through a
grated opening in the wall originally made for that purpose.
But it has been at the risk of our lives. We cannot
continue. If we should be discovered he would kill
us.’</p>

<p>“‘Whom do you mean by “he”?’ I asked.</p>

<p>“‘The leader among the soldiers.’</p>

<p>“‘What sort of a man is he?’</p>

<p>“‘A great, bull necked, big fisted man; with fierce and
cruel and blood shot eyes, and cheeks somewhat bruised
and swollen. I have heard him called Draco. This man
carries the key of the dungeon at his girdle day and
night. He treats us like dogs, and would kill us outright
in his terrible passion should he find us out. No,
we cannot afford to take such a risk for a single day
longer. We were worrying over the matter when you
came up.’</p>

<p>“‘Look here, woman!’ said I fiercely, ‘if you let
this Hebrew (for he is of our faith) perish, you will have
to account for it to both man and God; but, if you will
give him ample food and drink daily and help us to free
him, the lady Rachel promises to reward you richly—beyond
what you could dream. If there is risk in the matter<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_321" id="Page_321">[321]</a></span>
there is enough pay in it, too, to make it well worth
your while to take the risk. But I do not see that you
need to run any considerable risk. Where are these men
in the night?’</p>

<p>“‘They always pass the best part of the night in a
drunken carouse. They have found the wine cellar.’</p>

<p>“‘And, I dare say, by midnight they are lying about
the floor of the mess room dead drunk and stupid as
logs.’</p>

<p>“‘It may be.’</p>

<p>“‘And what is to hinder you from taking that time for
putting food, and whatever else his friends may wish
(this note for example), within reach of the prisoner?
The risk must be very small. Indeed I am not sure but
that you might safely steal in among the besotted and
snoring brutes, cut off the key from Draco’s belt, and
open the door of the dungeon. The lady Rachel would
enrich you for life.’</p>

<p>“The woman threw up her hands in dismay. ‘I
<em>could</em> not do it. The very idea of such a thing almost
frightens me to death. Besides, how do I know that the
daughter of Alexander will fulfill all your fine promises.
You always did talk larger than the truth. You never
spare fine talking in the way of business.’</p>

<p>“I confess this awfully embarrassed me. My habit in
dealing with my customers <em>has</em> been somewhat of the ornamental
and poetical sort. And now at last it had
brought me into difficulty. What should I do? I
silently promised myself that I would mend my ways. I
protested to the woman by all things sacred that I did
not misrepresent you. The miserable woman declared
she would not believe me. Nothing short of your own<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_322" id="Page_322">[322]</a></span>
lips should satisfy her. If you would come and with
your own mouth repeat my promises they would try to do
what they could. But she shook like one in a palsy when
she said it.</p>

<p>“Seeing that my reputation was too much for me, sinner
that I am; and that nothing better could be done, I
said, ‘You are unreasonable; but it shall be as you say.
The lady will come and confirm all I have said. But
meanwhile (here I drew out my bag of gold pieces) this is
what she has given me to reward those who take risks in
her service; and if you will daily put into the grated
opening plenty of food and drink, together with whatever
else I may give you, and will daily come to me in the upper
hamlet where you are in the habit of going for provisions,
and will swear that you have done so by the
beards of our fathers Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, I will,
each time, give you two gold pieces. And I will begin
now; for I want you to put this note into the dungeon
this very day. Swear to me that you will do it.’ And
I held up two shining pieces in the sun.</p>

<p>“Her eyes snapped. So did mine—the gold looked so
dazzling and lovely in the golden sun. As for the husband,
he sat with amazed eyes and open mouth, but said
nothing. Neither of them had seen such gold before.</p>

<p>“The woman stretched out her hand. I made her
swear, gave her the note you gave me, and then gave her
the two coins.</p>

<p>“Just then a man shouted to them from the castle in a
threatening tone; and they hurried away in a fright,
while I gathered up my wares as fast as I could and went
back to the hamlet. Here I scrawled a note to you, gave
it to my son whom I had taken the precaution to take<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_323" id="Page_323">[323]</a></span>
with me, and put him on board of a vessel for Alexandria
just then passing. Since then the custode has been to
me daily, made oath that she has fed the prisoner, and
received her gold pieces. She reports that Draco has
gone back to the city for a day or two; but that he has
left a substitute who wears the key of the dungeon at his
belt, and leads off every night in the drunken debauch.
I expect her every moment. It is about time for her to
make her daily visit.... There she is with her provision
basket! I will go and bring her on board.”</p>

<p>Rachel was struck with the air of the humbly dressed
and somewhat bent woman whom the peddler soon brought
up to her. She looked the picture of timidity and uncertainty—as
if drawn in opposite directions by powerful
forces, and almost torn in pieces in the struggle between
them. Her nerves were all on the wing. One could
warrant that no sound sleep had come to her for many a
night. She staggered rather than walked up to where
Rachel was sitting.</p>

<p>Rachel saluted her warmly; with her own hands
placed a cushion for her near herself; asked her name; by
degrees drew her out to tell of her former life in Alexandria
and of her bits of contact with the family of Alexander.
How long had she lived here? Were there others
of “our faith and race” in this neighborhood? Was she
holding fast to the God of Israel? And did she hear and
understand the chant from the prophet Daniel?</p>

<p>Seti sat silently by and listened to the gentle, soothing
tones in which, without any airs of condescension
and patronage, but simply as woman with woman and believer
with believer, the princess talked with the peasant,
till he saw the discomposure of the poor woman slowly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_324" id="Page_324">[324]</a></span>
give way to the winsome ways of one speaking to her as
from her own level. And yet what a contrast! The
fresh, glorious beauty and grace, fittingly arrayed, of the
one over against the faded features and crooked form and
rough garments of the other! Could it be that the two
were of the same race? No one who saw Rachel that day
could doubt that she at least thought so, and knew how
to make her lowly sister feel the same. Said Seti to
himself, “The last few days have ripened her like tropical
suns.” There are ways in which the great may put
themselves in sympathy and fellowship with the lowly
without putting on their dress, eating their food, living
in their cabins, and using their language.</p>

<p>“And this is my grandfather, Deborah,” at length
said Rachel, looking toward Seti, “who, though he is
high priest of Egypt, honors the God of our fathers and
loves our people. He shall be witness to what I will now
say to you. Our merchant friend here has told you how
much interested we are to rescue the young man of our
faith who is now in the castle dungeon. But Ezra was
not able to tell you, as I do now, that the young man was
not imprisoned by the government, but by a band of ruffians
on their own private feud; and that we have in our
hands a warrant from the governor to deliver him from his
enemies as best we can. But there are reasons why we
wish to do it as quietly as possible. Here you can help us.
You have already helped us by keeping our friend from
starvation. Now we want you to help us still further—in
fact, to help us free him this very night. If there is
any risk to you in what we shall now propose, we will reward
you accordingly. We will do for you all that our
agent the merchant has promised. We will make it unnecessary<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_325" id="Page_325">[325]</a></span>
for you to be a servant any more. If you
choose you shall go with us to Alexandria, and live at
your ease for the rest of your life. You know that
we are able to do as much as we say. Now, grandfather,
will you tell Deborah what we want her to
do?”</p>

<p>“Do you and your husband draw and carry the wine
every night to the soldiers?” inquired Seti.</p>

<p>The woman answered in the affirmative.</p>

<p>He went on, “Put this powder in the wine skin
from which you draw. It will not hurt the taste of the
wine, but the drunkards will sleep the sooner and sounder.
Doubtless there is somewhere on the grounds a large
pointed iron bar: is it not so?”</p>

<p>She replied that there was one in the provision cellar.</p>

<p>“It is well. In the course of the day contrive to introduce
the bar, with a note which I will give you fastened
to it, into the prison through the grated opening.
Will you do it?”</p>

<p>She bent her head in assent.</p>

<p>“One other thing—the hardest but most important of
all. As soon as the mess room is quiet after the debauch,
and the men are lying stupid with drunkenness and drug,
steal in on tiptoe and cut off the key from the girdle of
the captain, and unlock the dungeon door, if the young
man has not yet succeeded in prying it open. The drug
is so powerful that I think you can do it safely. If one
should happen to rouse, he would, very likely, think you
had come to bring more wine and relapse into his stupor.
When the young man is free, conduct him to the north
gate, which I know you have the key of; where we will
meet you with a number of men and conduct you all to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_326" id="Page_326">[326]</a></span>
the pinnace which by that time will be near the north
hamlet. Will you do this also?”</p>

<p>“Oh,” the woman exclaimed with almost an air of
distraction, “I am <em>so</em> afraid. Those wicked, frightful
men—how <em>can</em> I go in among them!”</p>

<p>Both Seti and Rachel talked long with her; plied her
with arguments and promises; and at last had the satisfaction
of seeing her more composed and firm, and of
hearing her promise that she would do as they wished.</p>

<p>As she rose to go, Rachel grasped her hand and said,
“Now be brave for a few hours and your fortune is made.
Do all we have said—do just as we have said. Do it for
the sake of the innocent, do it for Israel’s sake, do it for
our sakes who have some claims upon you, do it for your
own sakes for whom this day may do so much.”</p>

<p>As the woman was turning away, Seti held out to her
a vial filled with a colored liquid. “As evening comes
on pour this into a cup of water and drink it. It is a
cordial. It will strengthen and steady you for what you
have to do.... And then,” he added to Rachel, “the
note and plan to be fastened to the bar!”</p>

<p>She at once wrote thus: “To night we expect that
the guard will be stupid with wine and drug. When
they are fully quiet after their debauch, see what you can
do toward prying open your door. If you cannot succeed,
you may still hope that the door will be unlocked shortly
from without. Make your way out of the castle by
means of the inclosed plan, if no guide appears; and
meet your friends at the north gate.—R.”</p>

<p>She showed this to Seti, who nodded his approval.
Folding her copy of the plan into the note, she gave it to
the custode—charging her to put it through the grate<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_327" id="Page_327">[327]</a></span>
while it was still light enough to read the note and to see
how best to attack the door. The woman departed some
gold pieces richer than she came.</p>

<p>The peddler gathered up his wares, repacked them,
and went forward with his pack. Late in the day, at a
signal from Seti, the boatmen who had scattered themselves
along the bank, returned, unmoored the vessel,
pushed out silently into the stream, dropped silently
down past the castle, and as silently warped into another
sheltered nook very like that they had just left and about
as far from the castle.</p>

<p>Here the servants spread refreshments for Rachel and
her grandfather: and then a larger outspread was made
at the other end of the pinnace for the others. While
these were eating, Seti and Rachel went down among them
to speak a few kindly words, to see that their wants were
well supplied, and to ask all of them, save two or three
needed to stay by the vessel, to be ready late in the evening
to escort them in a short walk they were proposing to
take. It would not be amiss if they should take bludgeons
or other arms with them: they would find a plenty
of such below. Very likely arms would not be needed;
but then the place was neither Heaven nor the Diapleuston.
Is it necessary to state that no person was employed
on Alexander’s barge unless he was a Jew of his
own synagogue?</p>

<p>How should they spend the weary hours of waiting
before it would be time to set out for the gate? Seti did
something to answer this question.</p>

<p>As soon as the men had finished eating, he stepped to
the front of the dais with a roll in his hand, and invited
all of them to come near while he should read from their<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_328" id="Page_328">[328]</a></span>
Sacred Writings. He then proceeded to read from the
Septuagint the 93d and a part of the 94th Psalm. It was
very different reading from that artificial sub cantus
heard in the synagogues. It was the reading of a prophet
by a prophet, of a poet by a poet. Such a natural,
hearty, sympathetic rendering of the great thoughts—it
seemed as if the royal Psalmist, in the full glow of his
inspiration, was rehearsing his own words. The people
stood with open mouths and wondering eyes as the man
of three generations—his form erect, his eyes keen, his
hair but slightly frosted, his teeth perfect, his voice firm
and resonant, his whole bearing that of one who defies
decay—celebrated in grave and majestic tones the glory
of the One God, His justice, and the final overthrow of
the plans of the wicked. He closed by reading with special
slowness and emphasis these words, “<em>Who will rise
up for me against the evil doers—who will stand up for
me against the workers of iniquity?</em>”</p>

<p>Rolling up the parchment, he looked searchingly
about on the upturned faces.</p>

<p>“Friends,” said he, “we are not far from a den of
evil-doers. In yonder castle, a small band of ruffians,
without warrant from the authorities, have shut up in a
dungeon the young man who stood up so nobly for our
faith in the Diapleuston a few days ago. We are here
with a warrant from the governor to rescue him. We
expect this will be done about midnight without any
help from you. But we have promised to meet the rescuing
party at the north gate of the castle grounds with
our men and conduct them to the pinnace. We hope
that this will be all we need to do. But if we should be
disappointed, I want you to be ready with stout hearts<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_329" id="Page_329">[329]</a></span>
and arms to succeed where others have failed. The soldiers
are few, at midnight they will be drunk, the castle
will be open, and I who know every nook in it will be
your guide. Now, who of you will rise up for us against
the evil doers?”</p>

<p>“We will all go,” said one.</p>

<p>“Yes, <em>all</em>,” said another and another.</p>

<p>“There is none of us willing to be left behind,” exclaimed
the peddler as he looked around.</p>

<p>“And yet,” said Seti, “we must leave some with the
vessel. Ten of your stoutest will be enough to go with
us; and you may select these for yourselves....
Now let us kneel and pray to the God of Israel, who can
do great things for us whereof we shall be glad,” and, to
the astonishment of all, he kneeled, and spread forth his
hands heavenward, and invoked the blessing of the Most
High on their undertaking with the manner of one who
saw God and stood in his very presence. Few words, but
full of meaning and realization and devotion. And that
westering sun looked through the screen of palms on as
true and acceptable a prayer meeting as he sees to-day.</p>

<p>In the brief twilight that follows an Egyptian sun
setting, they saw a man running down to them from the
high road that skirted the bank. It proved to be the old
Egyptian custode. He was spent with running, and,
when brought up to Seti and Rachel, could hardly speak.
But at last he managed to let them know that he was
much afraid, from his wife’s growing agitation, that her
courage would fail at the critical moment. All appearances
promised an agony of fright and incapacity when
presence of mind would be most needed. He begged that
the lady, who only seemed to have power to soothe and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_330" id="Page_330">[330]</a></span>
hearten her, would not fail to come with the others. It
might save everything.</p>

<p>“I <em>will</em> come,” said Rachel; and, looking at Seti, she
added, “I had rather in any case go with you than remain
here in suspense.”</p>

<p>He made no reply to her, but said to the Egyptian as
he dismissed him with a present: “Do not forget to
have the north gate opened early—also the iron door leading
to the cellars. Have a lighted lantern ready as soon
as the soldiers are quiet.”</p>

<p>The stars came out one by one. Sirius flashed out
first; then Aldebaran; then the body and belt and sword
of Orion, together with Pleiades and Hyades and the
Chambers of the South—with their pageant universe.
No moon would appear till after midnight; but such was
the stellar effulgence that nothing more seemed needed
for such an enterprise.</p>

<p>The <em>flight</em> of Time! Yes, he is sometimes pictured
with wings as far stretching and mighty as an archangel’s;
and sometimes he seems to us to be plying them
with all his might. But not in such circumstances as our
friends were in. To eager, restless, suspenseful hearts,
hoping the best but fearing the worst, eager to work but
for the present able to do nothing, Time has no wings
at all, not even feet, but creeps along as if weighted with
untold chains. So crept he that night to Seti and Rachel.</p>

<p>But even the snail is at last found to have moved—the
most lingering hour that ever crept toward a man,
second by second, at last arrives—and so, at last, midnight
ached along and found Seti and his company at the north
gate. It was unfastened. So far, well.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_331" id="Page_331">[331]</a></span></p>

<p>They listened. They thought they could hear dull
strokes at carefully measured intervals. “Get nearer—as
near as you can,” said Seti to the peddler, “and see if
the sound does not come from the dungeon.”</p>

<p>In a few moments the man returned to say that the
prisoner was evidently at work on his door; but that the
custodes, both man and wife, were sitting in an apparently
helpless state on the steps before the iron door leading
to the vaults. He could scarcely get an intelligible
word from either of them.</p>

<p>“Let us go to them,” whispered Rachel to Seti; “let
us go to them alone. The men would only alarm and
confound them more.”</p>

<p>For answer he drew her arm still further within his;
and went cautiously forward through the shadows straight
toward the door of the vaults. Sure enough, there were
the custodes on the last step, cowering, trembling, moaning
faintly, almost stupid with terror. Rachel knelt by
the woman, took hold of her hand with one hand and
stroked her with the other, bade her be of good courage,
if only for a little.</p>

<p>“You see,” said she, “that I have come to help you.
Seti also is here; and many other helpers are behind.
Have you taken the cordial? Ah, I see that you have
forgotten it. Never mind, take it now. There, now I
hope you will soon feel better. What do you say? You
have no strength? You cannot go alone? Look, Deborah,
let us go together as far as the prison door and see
what progress has been made. Perhaps it will not be
necessary to go for the key. Come, lean on me.”</p>

<p>So the woman was persuaded to her feet. The potion
that Rachel had given her seemed beginning to take effect.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_332" id="Page_332">[332]</a></span>
Seti pushed open the iron door, found a lighted
lantern just within, cautiously descended the steps with
it, closely followed by the two women. Now the blows
were falling strong and fast; as if the prisoner knew that
no time was to be lost. They came to the grated opening
into the cell. Seti set the lantern by it. At once
the strokes ceased.</p>

<p>“Is it Aleph the Chaldean?” inquired the priest in a
voice scarcely above a whisper.</p>

<p>“Thank Heaven! it is the voice of Seti, my friend
and father,” answered a voice within.</p>

<p>“Will the door give way?” asked Seti.</p>

<p>“I fear not,” replied Aleph. “I cannot see where
to apply the bar, and so much of my labor is thrown
away. If a light could be introduced through the grating,
I could soon tell whether freedom is possible in this
way.”</p>

<p>“Can you get a narrow sconce that will pass through
the grate?” asked Seti of the custode.</p>

<p>The woman, without speaking, pointed in a vague way
toward the room above.</p>

<p>“Do nothing till we return,” said the priest to
Aleph. “We will find you a light, or something better.”</p>

<p>Then he whispered to Rachel, “There is but one
thing to be done. Seat the woman on this bench and
come. We must do without her. She might shriek or
fall among the men at any moment. Safer without her.”</p>

<p>The woman sank on the bench like a rag. Seti took
down the lantern, drew Rachel’s arm again within his
own, and softly made his way up a flight of steps to the
door of the mess room. He listened a moment. Nothing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_333" id="Page_333">[333]</a></span>
was audible but the dull hard breathing of the men
within.</p>

<p>He gently pressed the door open. The room was full
of lights of all sorts—as if the ruffians had been afraid of
darkness and meant to have as little of it as possible.
And all around—on benches, on the floor, under the
great table, hanging limp over the backs of chairs—were
the men in a state of swinish intoxication. Broken and
upset cups lay about everywhere. Pools of wine and
vomit were on the table and on the floor. The foul air
was almost intolerable.</p>

<p>Seti took up a sword that lay on the floor, and held
out the lantern to Rachel.</p>

<p>“No, grandfather,” she whispered, “this work is for
me. I can tread among them more lightly than you
can; and now I can see the key at the belt of yonder
man,” and she pointed to a man who sat at the head of
the table, his arms spread out upon it, and his head resting
on his arms.</p>

<p>He expostulated, “Perhaps the woman neglected to
drug the wine as she neglected her own cordial.”</p>

<p>Without replying, the maiden gathered her robes
tightly about her, and stepped in among the dangerous
brutes. Her feet fell as fall the snow-flakes. Around
one man, over the arm or leg of another, narrowly missing
the nodding head of a third—on she went through
those swine possessed with devils like some celestial vision,
with eye and foot steady and sure, till she reached
the farther end of the room and the side of the symposiarch.
She saw the key. Oh for a knife to sever it from
the belt! She could see nowhere any sharp cutting tool.
The man was snoring heavily; the snores got into a tangle,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_334" id="Page_334">[334]</a></span>
trembled, stopped. He groaned and moved. She
stood breathlessly over him with steady, flaming eyes till
his breathing became regular again; then, seizing a small
sconce from the table, she held it under the string that
fastened the key to the belt. In a moment the two
parted company. With lamp in one hand, and the key
with her draperies in the other, she made her way back
to the door and Seti as carefully as she went.</p>

<p>They passed out. Seti noiselessly closed the door,
drew up between it and an angle in the wall a stout
bench, and descended to the dungeon. Rachel put her
hand with the narrow lamp in it through the grate, and
whispered in an unsteady voice, “We have the key.
Take the light, and, if you have displaced the door somewhat,
replace it. Else the key may not work.”</p>

<p>He took it, made a few movements with his bar, then
said, “Now try the key.” Seti inserted it and tried to
turn—alas, the bolt would not move.</p>

<p>“Hand the key to me,” said Aleph; “perhaps I can
do better from the inside.”</p>

<p>It was passed through the grate. The outside hearts
stood still as the key was heard groping for its hole, then
stoutly pushed home, then beginning to turn in the
wards. Would it stop? Has it stopped? Ah, what a
moment that was! Human nature could not endure
many such strains. But hark! There is a sudden
mighty heave and push and wrench; and, oh joy! youth
and strength and Heaven have surely conquered. Back
flies the bolt with a loud noise that is musical as Paradise;
and lo, Aleph stands before them. Seti threw his arms
about him, and exclaimed, “My son—thank Heaven!”</p>

<p>“I also thank Heaven and my foster-father,” returned<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_335" id="Page_335">[335]</a></span>
Aleph warmly, as he returned the embrace; and
then, turning toward Rachel with eyes that even in the
dim light throbbed into hers thankfulness, and much besides
that made her face burn and her heart sing, he
added, “And there is another who will not be forgotten,
even the angel whom God has sent to shut the lions’
mouths so that they have not hurt me. I knew your
voice, and even your hand, as well as your chant, as you
came.”</p>

<p>“We must hasten,” interrupted the priest. “We
are not yet quite out of the lions’ den.”</p>

<p>Aleph at once went into the dungeon and brought out
his staff and the lamp.</p>

<p>“And Deborah? It will not do to leave the poor
woman here; and, shattered as she is, she cannot help
herself away. She failed us at the last moment, but she
did what she could,” whispered Rachel to Aleph as she
pointed to the custode on the bench.</p>

<p>He bent to look at the woman. “No, she cannot
walk, and must not be left. I will carry her.”</p>

<p>And he took her up as gently and as easily as one
might a babe; and so, following Seti, they went up the
steps to the iron door and then out under the blessed stars
that seemed to rejoice and exult with them. Seti did
not forget to make assurance of safety doubly sure by
putting another bolted door between them and pursuit.
They found the Egyptian sitting where they had left
him. He plainly was able to help himself: so, bidding
him follow, they moved on to the gate, where they found
the boatmen and peddler much alarmed at their long absence
and about going to seek them. This gate also they
immediately bolted after them—thus putting a third embarrassment<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_336" id="Page_336">[336]</a></span>
in the way of pursuit. The pinnace-men
could scarce restrain their joy and shouts when they saw
Aleph among them with the woman in his arms. They
did <em>not</em> restrain themselves as soon as the bolt of the gate
went clanging home, but sent up a shout full of heartiness
and victory. The newly risen moon seemed to shout
back again.</p>

<p>They reached the vessel without further adventure.</p>

<p>“Unmoor, men,” cried Seti, “and push out into the
river!”</p>

<p>When this had been done, and the pinnace was moving
gently with the current, his voice rose again. “Before
we spread our sails and take oars for Alexandria, let
us acknowledge Him who has answered our prayers.”
And so under the bright moonlight, floating gently down
the restful ancient river, with no sound on the air but
his own majestic voice, the high priest, as if primate of
all religions, gave thanks, in few and fitting words and
with uplifted hands, for the success of their enterprise to
Him “who executeth judgment for the oppressed, who
giveth food to the hungry, and who looseth the prisoners.”</p>

<p>Now up, men, with the sails! Now, ye oarsmen with
light hearts and strong arms, ply joyfully the oars homeward!
Aleph, sitting at the feet of Seti and Rachel, is
duly questioned and tells modestly his story; and he in
return soon comes to know all that we know about the
measures taken for his rescue—also about the situation
of Cimon, in regard to whom his concern seemed to have
been greater than for himself. For the most part Seti
told the story. And he told it well. Rachel certainly
had no reason to complain that justice was not done to
the part she had taken in the matter. And she saw more<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_337" id="Page_337">[337]</a></span>
eloquent speaking in the two luminaries that occasionally
beamed up into hers than she had ever seen in moon and
stars—or even the sun.</p>

<p>But toiling men must have rest and sleep. So, after
the lapse of an hour or so, during which good progress
had been made, the boatmen moored again under the
screen of another leafy grove that overhung the river and
laid themselves down wherever they best could. Seti and
Rachel retired below. As for Aleph, he had had enough
of inactivity. The sense and delight of freedom once
more were strong within him. He leaped ashore; and
walked about in the grove, and sometimes on the highway
from Alexandria which in general followed the banks of
the river, and which the Romans, according to their
wont, kept in the best condition. While on this thoroughfare
he heard the sound of wheels and the tramp of
furiously driven horses coming from the north. He
stepped into the grove. The noise rapidly grew, and
soon became mixed with the voices of men in angry dispute.
As the voices came still nearer—could it be?—Aleph
thought he recognized the voice of Draco. Then
appeared a chariot drawn by two foaming horses, with
four men seated in it. When nearly abreast of him the
horses suddenly stopped.</p>

<p>“We will go no farther,” exclaimed the voice of
Draco, “till this matter is settled. We mean that he
shall die; and we also mean to be paid well for what we
have done for you. We must have enough to pay us for
the loss of our situations, and to keep us in Rome, or
wherever we choose to go, for the rest of our lives. We
want the talents down—all of them. We are not a-going
to trust you for a yearly stipend, which may and may not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_338" id="Page_338">[338]</a></span>
be paid; we must have everything in our own power.
You did not promise so much? But you promised to pay
us liberally; and the pay must be what <em>we</em> call liberal.
Cannot get so many talents? You can at least steal them
from your father, or from the treasury of the province—we
do not care which. We do not care how you come by
the money if so be that we get it.”</p>

<p>In the course of the violent altercation that followed
Aleph recognized three other voices—that of the equestrian
trainer, that of Antis, and that of Sextus Flaccus
who seemed in a half drunken state. He also gathered
that Sextus had been berating the trainers for their defeat
by Aleph until the passionate men had been provoked
beyond measure, lost all self-control, and were
ready to do almost anything to gratify their resentment.
Sextus was too much in wine to see his danger; kept on
abusing them roundly; and even went so far as to threaten
that he would pay them little or nothing for their services.
This had brought matters to a crisis.</p>

<p>“Now,” said Draco at last, with an oath as horrible as
a pagan or an atheist could swear, “let us have done with
this. Tell us, Sextus Flaccus, what you will do—yes or
no. Will you promise by the soul of your mother, the
only oath you are likely to keep, that within five days,
by hook or by crook, you will pay over to us the money
we demand? If not, you drunken fool, we will strangle
you on the spot and throw your body into the river. It
will be said that you fell into the river in a drunken fit.
And everybody will believe the story—even your own
father. Swear, I say, or <em>die</em>, <em class="smcap">die</em>. We can help ourselves
at the castle to more than you are likely to give
us, if it be true, as we hear, that your father hides his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_339" id="Page_339">[339]</a></span>
treasures there; and then we will take to the desert and
have everybody for a prey. Come!”</p>

<p>Nothing came from Sextus but a new volley of provoking
epithets and threats.</p>

<p>The two trainers grasped him. A struggle followed.
“Drive on a little farther to a better spot,” cried Draco
to Antis.</p>

<p>The horses sprang forward under the lash and soon
disappeared. But Aleph could hear the noise of scuffle,
muffled calls for help, half suffocated cries of terror. He
ran after the chariot as fast as possible: at length descried
it standing by the roadside empty. At the same time he
heard a loud splash and saw three men run up from the
river bank, leap into the chariot, and drive off at a furious
pace. It was vain to pursue—perhaps he might rescue
the victim. So he rushed to the bank which the men had
just left; and leaned over the water, holding by a friendly
sapling that bent over the stream. At first he could see
nothing, coming as he did from the bright moonlight;
but in a moment he saw a hand just sinking beneath the
water—saw also a crocodile close by in the act of turning
over to seize his prey. Quick as thought he struck at the
monster with his staff, and then, plunging his arm deep
in the water, caught the fingers of Sextus just as they
were passing out of reach, and drew the body to the bank.
It was apparently lifeless. The proper way of treating
such a body is no discovery of modern times. Aleph was
not ignorant of it, promptly used it, and found signs that
life was not extinct, though flickering in its socket. He
took up the body and hastened to return to the pinnace.
He found it all alive with anxiety at his disappearance—especially
after the sounds of strife and rushing wheels<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_340" id="Page_340">[340]</a></span>
had faintly come to them. Seti and Rachel met him, as
he stepped on board with his burden, with a joyful welcome
and inquiring looks.</p>

<p>“Sextus Flaccus, nearly or quite murdered by his
comrades—first throttled, and then drowned!”</p>

<p>A few swift words of further explanation, and Aleph
hastened to the dais with his burden, and for a long time
bent every energy to restore the vital warmth—by posture,
by friction, by wrapping in rugs, by aiding the ribs
in the scarcely perceptible breathing movement, by fanning—Seti
assisting with advice and hands. It was a
hard fight with death; but at last came signs that their
labor would not be in vain. Sextus breathed regularly
though feebly. His throat, which they had laid bare,
and which was all bruised and discolored by the strangling
hands of the ruffians, showed the efforts of the vital fluid
to resume a forceful circulation. At last he moaned and
opened his eyes. Opened them on Aleph as he knelt before
him, fanning him, gently adjusting his position and
wraps as usefully as possible. Opened them at first in a
vague, bewildered stare into which soon came a grain of
intelligence, then of astonishment, then of alarm. He
tried to raise himself. Aleph gently helped him. Then
followed a fixed gaze of absorbed inquiry in which
thought seemed wrestling with thought, each demanding
of each, <i>What means all this? Is it possible?</i> He then
quietly closed his eyes and seemed trying to recollect
himself. Seti and Rachel kept well behind, and watched
with breathless interest. Again Sextus opened his eyes—this
time with full intelligence in them. He tried to
speak. No sound came. He tried again. Aleph put
his ear near the struggling lips.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_341" id="Page_341">[341]</a></span></p>

<p>“Are you Aleph the Chaldean?” came in the faintest
of whispers.</p>

<p>Aleph nodded.</p>

<p>“Aleph the prisoner?”</p>

<p>Aleph nodded again.</p>

<p>“Did you save me from the men, and the Nile, and—the
crocodile?” Sextus asked in a stronger voice.</p>

<p>“What, did you notice the crocodile?” said Aleph.
“I thought you were beyond noticing anything.”</p>

<p>“I saw him preparing to seize me—saw something
worse than a crocodile; for all my follies and sins of many
years, including my treatment of you, came up before me
in one dreadful flash. Ah, it was a dreadful sight—worse
than any monster on sea or land!”</p>

<p>“You see that it is possible to escape from monsters
that are very near,” said Aleph soothingly. “But I
would not talk any more just now. You are too weak.
Let me adjust the rugs and wraps more comfortably for
you, and lie down again. You are among friends.”</p>

<p>Sextus bent another long wondering gaze at the noble
face that was bending over him, and then resigned himself
with closed eyes to the gentle hands that laid him
carefully down to a smoother and softer resting place.
In a few moments he was asleep.</p>

<p>“Well,” said Seti, with a grave smile, “you <em>are</em> a very
strange young man. Is this the way you treat enemies
in your country? If so it is very unlike any other country
that I happen to know. Still, I confess that the
way, unprecedented as it is, has a good look to it, and
may be worth introducing into Egypt.”</p>

<p>“Say not <em>unprecedented</em>, my dear grandfather,” said
Rachel, “for you know Deity treats men better than<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_342" id="Page_342">[342]</a></span>
they deserve; and the Christ, it seems, does the same.
How forbearing he is toward his enemies, when he could
so easily overwhelm them!”</p>

<p>Aleph was looking dreamily at the banks now fast
gliding by (for the pinnace was in full motion again and
the dawn was kindling all things into color and beauty),
but at the word <i>Christ</i> he turned inquiringly toward Rachel.
She understood him.</p>

<p>“Yes,” she said, “we have something new to tell you
about the Christ—something new and wonderful that
comes from a witness that I can trust—my own mother”—and
she proceeded to relate to him the history of the
resurrection of Lazarus and the consequent exasperation
and plottings of his enemies.</p>

<p>“Having had little else to do, I have been thinking
much of Him during the last few days,” returned Aleph,
“especially of what the prophets, Isaiah and Daniel, say
of his suffering character. ‘He was wounded for our
transgression, he was bruised for our iniquities, and the
Lord has laid on him the iniquities of us all: he was
taken from prison and from judgment, and who shall declare
his generation, for he was cut off out of the land of
the living.’ And Daniel says, ‘And after three score
and two weeks shall the Messiah be cut off, but not for
himself.’ So I am expecting the worst and the best—the
greatest sacrifice and the greatest salvation the world
has ever seen. Jesus is surely a king; but at present his
kingdom is not of this world. He will pass to his throne
through the gates of death. Then of his kingdom there
will be no end.”</p>

<p>He said this as a seer might say it, and with a new
light in his face.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_343" id="Page_343">[343]</a></span></p>

<p>Sextus slumbered on, hour after hour, as the vessel
glided down the silent river and the sun glided up the
silent sky. Their morning meal was spread for them and
still he slept. But when they raised their heads, after the
priest had thanked Him who giveth to all their food, they
saw that his eyes were wide open and fastened on them.
Aleph at once went to him, helped him to a sitting posture,
propped him with cushions and rugs, and then
brought him fruits and other food. He was now able to
eat, though but very slowly. Aleph did not leave him
till his slow repast was quite finished, and he was again
settled into a restful position. During all this he said
not a word.</p>

<p>It was not long after the meal and the general religious
service that immediately followed that they saw in
the distance and coming toward them a large galley evidently
crowded with people. As it approached they recognized
the young men of the University; and the young
men at the same time recognized the commanding form
of Aleph, who had risen for a better view of the craft in
which Seti seemed so interested. What a shout from
young throats suddenly broke into the sky! What a
climbing into all high places and lookouts! What a
frantic flourish of hands and caps—yea, of spears and
swords and bucklers; for it was now plain that something
besides a cordial reception of a returning friend was in
the thought of the young men when they left Alexandria.
They were prepared to fight as well as to celebrate.</p>

<p>“Hail Aleph the Chaldean!” Three times they had
given this uproarious greeting with full lungs and wild
gesticulations; and there is no telling when they would
have stopped had not Aleph stepped on the bulwark toward<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_344" id="Page_344">[344]</a></span>
the galley and beckoned to them. They instantly
became silent.</p>

<p>“You see, my friends, that the venerable Seti has
found me, and found me safe and sound—thanks to
Heaven and him. No matter where, no matter how: he
desires that no questions he asked about these things.
My arrest and abduction were not by the authorities: they
were a private enterprise altogether for which we may
hold Draco responsible, if we can lay hands on him.
Apart from him all is buried. Many thanks to you for
the generous interest you have taken in the stranger, for
the efforts and pains you have been at on my account, and
of which I have been duly informed. I did not know
when I joined the University what a company of generous
and warm hearted associates I would have. If my
arm were long enough I would grasp the hand of every
one of you. Suppose it done till we meet again. Once
more; in return for your warm greetings, I am sure that
I can give not only my own but those of the dear friends
in whose hands you see me, and without whom I should
not be here to-day.”</p>

<p>Pausing a moment, he added, “I have a favor to ask.
We have with us a sick friend for whom quiet and rest
are needed. For this and other reasons we propose that
you precede or follow us at a considerable interval; and
that we enter the city apart in as quiet and undemonstrative
a way as possible. We can demonstrate at our leisure
hereafter. I certainly shall want to demonstrate my
gratitude.”</p>

<p>One great cheer for the speaker; and another for
“the empress of Alexandria” as they now discovered
Rachel beneath the curtain which she had hastily let fall<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_345" id="Page_345">[345]</a></span>
between herself and the approaching galley; and then
the galley silently dropped behind—far behind. But our
friends could hear faintly from it the music of song and
instrument, and faintly see the flutter of banners and
streamers of all sorts all the way along the river and
canal. But when they entered the lake they quite lost
sight and hearing of the galley. So the pinnace came
quietly to its old moorings.</p>

<p>Up to this time Sextus had sat silent and almost motionless
where he had been placed. He now threw off
his wraps and attempted to rise. With the help of Aleph,
who hastened to him, he succeeded; but he was not able
to stand alone.</p>

<p>“I see a close palanquin on the shore,” said Aleph.
“I will beckon for it, and if you somewhat muffle the
lower part of your face, you will not be recognized. I
will order the bearers to take you to Bruchium.”</p>

<p>Sextus looked gratefully at him, and said in a low but
decisive voice, “I shall not forget this, as you soon will
have occasion to know.”</p>

<p>So they parted with mutual pressure of the hand.</p>

<p>Then Aleph parted from Seti and Rachel—saying to
the latter as she reminded him of his promise to see Miriam,
“Shall I also see the empress of Rome?” His voice
was somewhat unsteady.</p>

<p>She hesitated for a moment, and then said, impulsively,
“You will never see her, if earth and Heaven can
prevent it;” and her face shone with a determination
that was almost fierce.</p>

<p>“If I only wore a diadem, I know at whose feet it
would be laid”—he said it simply, as to himself.</p>

<p>“Aleph the Chaldean already wears a diadem which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_346" id="Page_346">[346]</a></span>
the daughter of Alexander values more than any that will
ever shine on the banks of the Tiber,” was the reply.</p>

<p>What is the use of being a princess and, by invitation,
an empress, if she cannot speak her mind frankly? But
what <em>is</em> her mind? Seti might have used the same words.
From his lips they would have meant high approval and
even admiration. Was this all that she meant? Did she
only pay such fitting intellectual tribute to Aleph as one
pays to an admirable statue, to the glorious stars, or to
each of a hundred shining historic persons? We admire
them and praise them—but we can live without them.
We can leave the admirable statue in its palace or temple
and very contentedly go about our business, never to see
it again. We can praise Plato to the skies, and yet be
quite willing to have him and his Republic remain some
twenty odd centuries away from us. Who has a right to
say that such was not the mind of Rachel?—appreciative,
outspoken, Setian, and—nothing more?</p>

<h3>XV.<br />
<span class="smaller">THE CONFERENCES.</span></h3>

<p>There were several reasons why the first wonder and
rush of surmises as to the reappearance of Aleph
did not last long. They were let alone severely. And
then the rumors of an approaching visit from the Cæsar
grew stronger every day; and all eyes and tongues were
strongly drawn toward the daughter of Alexander and
her probable views and feelings as to the great alliance.
In addition, the air was now full of the great trials that
were to come off in a few days—Malus against the two
brothers, Malus against Cimon, and Cimon against Malus.
That Malus should venture to attack anybody was not a
matter for surprise; but that anybody should venture to
attack Malus was indeed wonderful. So the city had
plenty to talk about without querying long as to the
where and how of Aleph’s escape, with nobody to answer
questions.</p>

<p>The public interest grew exceedingly when it became
plain, as it soon did, that the contest would not be between
two individuals, but between two great parties.
On the one side were Malus and the Flacci with their
host of dependents: on the other was Cimon, supported
by all the influence and forces of Seti and Alexander, as
well as by the good-will and prestige and family influence<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_350" id="Page_350">[350]</a></span>
of both branches of the University, with which Aleph
was now unboundedly popular. Though he firmly declined
to give any information as to who the chief criminal
in his abduction was, and what the place of his confinement,
and how he was rescued, the students were not
offended—following the lead of Cornelius and a few
others who had specially attached themselves to him, and
to whom he had said that his silence was to save embarrassment
to Cimon and other friends in their affairs.
They looked in his face and believed him. They heard
the ring of his voice and were content both with him and
his friend—with Cimon, <em>because</em> he was his friend. As
Malus soon had occasion to know. Not a student entered
his warehouse. If one saw him coming he ostentatiously
crossed to the other side of the street. And the vexed
trader was compelled to listen to some serenades that
were neither very musical nor very complimentary. Of
all such demonstrations in his favor, Aleph was ignorant;
though he was well aware on what side the sympathies of
his fellow-students were enlisted.</p>

<p>I have said that the public assumed that the Flaccan
influence would be cast in favor of Malus. But one day
an event occurred which unsettled at least the University
part of the public on this point. At the close of one of
Seti’s lectures and before the students had left, a herald
appeared at the door and announced his Excellency the
Governor. Seti stepped forward after a very cool and
stately fashion to receive the dignitary; and inquired
what he could do to pleasure his Excellency. His Excellency
stated that he was fond of young men, and liked
to look in upon them now and then, in their curriculum;
but that his special object to-day was to congratulate both<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_351" id="Page_351">[351]</a></span>
him and his young friend, who he believed was called
<i>Aleph the Chaldean</i>, on the success of the measures for
the rescue of the latter.</p>

<p>“I <em>do</em> congratulate you most heartily, venerable Sir—as
I know that you are much interested in the young
man. Is he present?” And Flaccus looked about on
the students as if to discover him.</p>

<p>“Will Aleph the Chaldean come forward?” said
Seti: “His Excellency wishes to congratulate him in
person on his safety.”</p>

<p>The young men were too much interested in what was
passing to stand on ceremony. The better to see everything,
they stepped on the seats and pommelled down obnoxious
shoulders and heads. And they saw Aleph advance,
not only without embarrassment, but with a grace
and even majesty that would have become a king. And
yet the kingly way was so unaffected and so modest in its
expression, as not to be offensive.</p>

<p>“May it please your Excellency,” said Seti with emphasis,
“this is the young man for whom you have asked
and whom you authorized us to rescue at all costs.”</p>

<p>“I am glad I did it. It was one of the best acts of
my life,” exclaimed Flaccus, as he looked up with undisguised
astonishment at the figure and face before him.</p>

<p>Then with some hesitation he continued, “You do
not seem, young man, to have suffered much from your
confinement. It could hardly have been very severe
without leaving some marks upon you. I see none whatever.
I would not object to being confined myself if I
could reappear in as good a condition as yours.”</p>

<p>“Still, such a confinement as mine is not one which
I can conscientiously recommend to your Excellency,”<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_352" id="Page_352">[352]</a></span>
returned Aleph. “It had some features about it rather
trying to the average constitution. I think that the fact
that I am here to-day in a sound condition is due to my
having a constitution considerably tougher than the average.”</p>

<p>“No doubt it is so,” said the Roman. “I am glad
that you have come off so well. I have come here to say
so; to express my pleasure at your safe return; to congratulate
you upon it; and also to congratulate you on
having secured in so brief a time such warm and most
desirable friends as I see about you. I trust you will
count me among them.”</p>

<p>“Aleph the Chaldean accepts with pleasure the kind
words which your Excellency does him the honor of offering;
and himself feels that he has been highly favored in
finding in a strange land so many friends whom he will
never be willing or able to forget.”</p>

<p>“I have another object in coming here to-day,” continued
Flaccus. “My son, who is sick, begs that you will
visit him at the Cæsareum. Your nation, I believe, is
well versed in leech craft; and perhaps you can help
him. If you will take a seat with me in my chariot it
will gratify both him and me.”</p>

<p>“I will go to your son almost immediately,” said
Aleph. “But your Excellency will excuse me for declining
the honor of your chariot. A less distinguished
way of going will better suit my youth and circumstances.”</p>

<p>To say that the students were astonished hardly does
the facts justice. Three things amazed them—that the
Governor should take a step so likely to be understood
by the public as against Malus; that Sextus Flaccus, sick<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_353" id="Page_353">[353]</a></span>
or well, should send for Aleph; and that Aleph should
carry himself in so unembarrassed and independent and
yet courtly manner in the presence of the chief Roman
dignitary. It was another revelation to them. Some of
them said, “Plainly, this is not the first time Aleph has
dealt with people in high places—he is too much at home
with them to be dealing with novelties.”</p>

<p>Both that day, and daily for many days afterward,
Aleph found his way to the Cæsareum, and to the slowly
recovering Sextus. What was said or done in these interviews
never transpired—at least among the students.
I am not prepared to say but that Seti and Rachel came
to know of pleasant and hopeful things.</p>

<p>Well, it <em>is</em> time to speak again of the lovely Jewess.
Of course Aleph, the very next day after his return, fulfilled
his promise to see Miriam—and all the more readily
because Seti had domiciled himself at Alexander’s until
the return of his son in law. He found not only Miriam
but also Seti and Rachel in the family apartment. Great
was his surprise at the gain the nurse had made since he
last saw her; and so he was able to give congratulations
as well as receive them. Miriam’s congratulations, however,
were rather lame in the expression; for when she
saw him enter without any sign, even the slightest, of
harm from all that he had passed through, her eyes filled
with tears and she scarcely found voice to say more than,
<i>Thank God</i>.</p>

<p>“You see,” said Rachel, “that Miriam has wonderfully
improved within the last few days; but I doubt
whether you can guess to what the improvement is
owing.”</p>

<p>“The skill of the leech?” suggested Aleph, smiling.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_354" id="Page_354">[354]</a></span></p>

<p>“Nay—as if you did not know her leech!” and she
lifted her eyebrows.</p>

<p>“The excellent nursing?”</p>

<p>“By no means—I can speak for that.”</p>

<p>“The <em>want</em> of nursing? The nurse has been busy
elsewhere; and so nature has had a chance to act freely.
Excessive care is sometimes as hurtful as no care at all.”</p>

<p>“Still at fault,” cried the maiden. “Shrewd as you
are, you will not be likely to guess: so I must tell you.
She took a new medicine; and it was <i>Aleph the Chaldean</i>.
Devising ways and means to get you out of your
difficulties, O much enduring Ulysses, O pious Æneas
beaten about in all seas—this is what has made the
change that you see. It is a very healthful business this
rescuing Aleph the Chaldean.”</p>

<p>Then followed a pleasant explanation of the part
which Miriam had taken in the rescue, and such a grateful
recognition of it as it deserved.</p>

<p>On the humorous plea that Miriam was indebted to
him for her health, and must make payment for the
same in valuable information, Aleph proceeded to ask her
many questions suggested by her former narrative of what
she had heard and seen of Jesus. Rachel joined him in
this. As a result they found not a few difficulties removed
or diminished by a better knowledge of circumstances.</p>

<p>During this questioning and cross questioning Seti
sat a silent but alert listener. Only at the close, when
the young people fairly woke up to the fact that for a
long time he had said nothing, and turned deprecatingly
toward him, did he say, “You two would make very respectable
advocates. I hope Marcus Piso will examine<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_355" id="Page_355">[355]</a></span>
witnesses as well in the approaching trials. I am glad to
see that your faith in Jesus does not forget the claims of
reason.”</p>

<p>Here a parcel was brought in and given to Rachel.
“From my mother,” she exclaimed, as she glanced at
the superscription. “This doubtless contains further
news of the Christ that will interest us all. Let us
see.”</p>

<p>She broke the seals. In a moment she became so absorbed
in her reading that, evidently, she was quite oblivious
of her surroundings. Her face became a mirror
behind which appeared the whole changing heaven of her
moods and feelings. The first glance at the letter
brought a shadow on the beaming countenance. As she
went on the shadows deepened apace—as when clouds
add themselves to clouds in advance of the storm. At
last the storm itself came. Her face became a picture of
mingled astonishment, compassion, indignation, and dismay.
She dropped the letter on the floor, exclaiming,
“<i>Can it be! Where is the Almighty Avenger!</i>” And the
tears streamed between her fingers as she buried her face
in her hands.</p>

<p>Seti and Aleph had both watched her changing expressions
with alarm—had both risen and were now
standing by her side.</p>

<p>“What dreadful thing has happened, my child?”
asked Seti.</p>

<p>“They have murdered Him—<em>murdered</em> Him—have
murdered the <span class="smcap">Christ</span>!” she exclaimed: then turning to
Aleph, “And you were right. You feared the worst, and
the worst has come. Can there be a bright side to such
a picture?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_356" id="Page_356">[356]</a></span></p>

<p>She tried to brush away the tears that she might better
see the expression of his face.</p>

<p>He said gently, “I think I can conceive of a brighter
side even to such a terrible picture. But I see that you
have not finished your reading. Perhaps the remainder
of the letter will contain the brighter side.” He took it
up from the floor and handed it to her.</p>

<p>Thus encouraged, she resumed her reading. Almost
immediately a change appeared on her face. Her eyes
opened widely with a new wonder, and beamed with a
new light. As she went on the shadows thinned away as
fast as they had thickened; the light and sweetness grew
apace as does the fairest morning; and at last the sun
rose on every lovely feature as she finished the manuscript
and exclaimed, <i>God be praised—there is indeed a brighter
side!</i></p>

<p>She turned to Aleph, “You are right again. Jesus
lives. He has passed through death to his throne.”</p>

<p>“I do not think,” said he, “that you are now able to
read to us the whole wonderful account as your mother
has written it. But perhaps you can give us a briefer account
in your own words—suiting the length to your
strength, and passing lightly over details that have tried
you most.”</p>

<p>“I will try. But I think that I could not even do
this were it not for the strength and courage which this
last reading has given me.”</p>

<p>After a moment she proceeded: “From the time of
the resurrection of Lazarus the chief men at Jerusalem,
with two exceptions, have been bent on the death of
Jesus. On the night before the Passover, they sent an
armed force to Gethsemane, where he was praying, arrested<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_357" id="Page_357">[357]</a></span>
him, took him to the palace of the high-priest,
went through a form of trying him for blasphemy, condemned
him (two only objecting), then hurried him
to Pilate the governor; and so importuned and worried
and threatened the reluctant Roman that he at last
consented, but not until they had taken on themselves
and their children the whole guilt of the deed, to condemn
him to the cross. Then followed mocking, and
buffeting and scourging. Then in the early morning, accompanied
by many weeping and wailing friends and a
mob of howling and exulting enemies, the soldiers took
him to Calvary and there crucified him between two robbers.
Oh, the cruel, cruel spikes! Oh, the more cruel
jeers and mockings and tauntings and railings of the soldiers—and
even of his fellow sufferers! They evidently
were suffering far less than he. Those familiar with crucifixions
had never before seen such agony. All the signs
of an inexpressible anguish were in both face and form.
And once he uttered a cry so terrible that Nicodemus,
who heard it, said that it would haunt him to his dying
day. He had never heard the like before: never could
bear to hear the like again. He is fully persuaded that
the sun in all his circuits had never looked down on such
mortal agony, because it was the agony of Him on whom
‘God laid the iniquities of us all.’ In fact, the sun refused
at length to look on the awful scene any longer.
He had climbed over the eastern hills, and up to the
zenith, with undimmed face, when, all at once, he disappeared.
For three hours the darkness of God was over
the whole land. Men could hardly see one another.
But the darkness of men was still greater than the
darkness of God. They still continued to cast at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_358" id="Page_358">[358]</a></span>
Jesus through the lurid dimness the stones of their
derision and insult until the end. At the ninth
hour the great Victim died—praying for his enemies.
Then the earth quaked mightily. Ancient rocks that
had defied men and time broke in pieces before the silent
cross. The veil of the temple was rent in twain by unseen
hands. Even dead men came from their graves, to
meet Jesus as he descended into his. ‘<i>Truly</i>,’ said the
centurion who had the crucifixion in charge, ‘<i>truly this
was the Son of God!</i>’</p>

<p>“When all was over, the disciples smote their breasts
and returned to the city, filled with horror and almost
despair. Who could have thought it! Is there really no
humanity on earth, and no divinity in Heaven! Is this
the end of their hopes—this the end of their long and
fondly expected kingdom of God! From the towering
summits of faith to the depths of doubt and misery—what
a fall! My mother was not able to see the more
immediate disciples for two or three days; for she was
crushed in both body and heart: but Nicodemus kept her
informed as to everything. Besides, she knew how they
were feeling from knowing how she felt herself. She
was prostrated before the awful mystery. She was dazed
and almost incapable of thought under the mighty shock.
And yet she had at the bottom of her heart a feeling that
this could not be the end. God <em>cannot</em> be so defeated by
man.</p>

<p>“So much for the tragedy. Had this been all that my
mother wrote I could never have smiled again. Her account
filled me with shame and horror and wrath. It
seemed to me that God would have been just if he had at
once smitten those murderers into the lowest Tophet.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_359" id="Page_359">[359]</a></span>
God forgive me! but I almost felt as if I could do it myself.
I felt as if I belonged to an accursed and doomed
race. Yes, I felt as if I could never smile again. But
you see that I can (and her face wet with tears shone out
upon him, with bewildering radiance); and it is because
the tragedy has a triumph for its sequel.</p>

<p>“On the third day after the crucifixion Nicodemus
came home in great excitement, saying that the Roman
guard which Pilate, at the solicitation of the Jewish chiefs,
had set about the tomb where the body of Jesus had been
placed, came into the city early in the morning and reported
to the chiefs with scared faces and trembling lips
that One with a form bright as the lightning had flashed
down from the sky in their sight, rolled away the stone
from the door of the sepulchre, and sat upon it. They
fell to the earth, and became as dead men. When they
came to themselves they found the angel gone and the
tomb open and empty. Great was the perplexity of the
leaders on hearing this; but they finally resolved, Nicodemus
and Joseph of Arimathea protesting, to fortify one
crime by another, and gave a large sum of money to the
soldiers to say that the body was stolen while they slept.
This recalled vividly to my mother’s mind what Jesus
had once said, but which, in common with the other disciples,
she had taken as having some figurative meaning,
‘<i>And the third day I will rise again</i>.’</p>

<p>“Soon after, one of the maids of the house, who also
was a disciple and had been out at the market, came
hastily home, saying that some of the apostles and others
had seen angels at the sepulchre who told them that Jesus
had risen—had even seen Jesus himself and spoken with
him. My mother could no longer restrain herself, but<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_360" id="Page_360">[360]</a></span>
hurried away to a place where the disciples were wont to
gather; and found many assembled. The room was in a
fever of restless pacings to and fro, of eager questionings
and answerings. Seen him? Spoken with him? Sure
there is no mistake? Peter and certain women were in
great request, for they could say <i>Yes</i> to all such questions.
The joy of assured conviction shone in some
faces; a hope that still feared in others. It seemed too
good to be true. Thomas, one of the Twelve, declared it
could not be true: there must be some delusion in it—either
of the senses, or the nerves, or the imagination.
He would not believe without the concurrent witness of
at least three senses. He had scarcely said this, when,
though the doors were closed, they saw Jesus himself
standing among them with the well-known form and features
and voice; and he said to Thomas, ‘Reach hither
thy finger and behold my hands; and reach hither thy
hand and thrust it into my side; and be not faithless but
believing.’ Thomas broke down at once. Doubt was
impossible. Not a ray of hesitation remained with any.
None understood the sublime march of events; none
knew what prodigies were yet to come, whether his enemies
would now be swept away and a visible Divine Kingdom
set up, or not; but of this all were sure that he who
had died on the cross was again alive among them. And
they rejoiced with exceeding great joy—though the joy
yet felt the swell and tossing of the just departed storm.</p>

<p>“Since then my mother has seen the Messiah several
times. But he never shows himself to the people at
large. It is now understood among the disciples that in
a short time, after meeting them in Galilee, he will return
to Heaven—leaving his disciples to preach in his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_361" id="Page_361">[361]</a></span>
name forgiveness of sins to all nations who will repent
and believe.”</p>

<p>“I think I will read to you,” added Rachel, “the
last page or two of the letter, that you may see what
views are now being held by those immediately about
Jesus as to his person and work.” She read:</p>

<p>“Now we all know that my thought was right—that
his death was an atonement for the sins of all men; and
that the victims which have been offered from the beginning
were only types of this great Victim. And I say to
myself, What must be the nature and dignity of him
whose death can atone for all human sin? Must he not
be Divine as well as human? Must he not be God manifest
in the flesh? Who else could make so mighty an expiation?—who
else save he of whom it is written, ‘And
the government shall be upon his shoulder, and his name
shall be called Wonderful, Counsellor, the mighty God,
the Everlasting Father,’ and who has said of himself,
‘I and my father are one?’</p>

<p>“I cannot return home just yet—much as I wish to
see you and others. This great opportunity of seeing
and hearing for a brief time longer the Redeemer of the
world is too precious to be sacrificed. Besides, the successive
tides of grief and joy have so shaken me that I
am unfit to travel.</p>

<p>“Read what I have written to your dear grandfather.
Oh, that he were here—his fairness of mind and penetration
would be sure to place him on the side of Jesus.</p>

<p>“Of course I have written the same things to your dear
father and brothers at Rome—hoping that amid their
great schemes of business and ambition they will find
room for faith, <em>my</em> faith. May they not be among ‘The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_362" id="Page_362">[362]</a></span>
rulers who take counsel together against the Lord and
against his Anointed?’ As to you I have no doubt, even
though the lot of Esther”—the maiden broke off abruptly
with a flush and a shudder, and busied herself
for a little in adjusting the leaves of the manuscript.</p>

<p>This letter led to a long conversation; I should say to
long conversations. Daily, for many days, Aleph came
to his friends; and daily the great theme was Jesus the
Christ. Seti never failed to be present, and never failed
to be silent—save when a brief inquiry could bring light.
But, the day before the trials were to begin, he was absent,
arranging last things with his lawyer. Miriam also was
absent.</p>

<p>The unfailing and unwearying topic of topics again
came up; and after a delightful talk about the past and
the future of the Messianic history, Aleph inquired about
the attitude of Seti.</p>

<p>“My own impression has been,” said he, “that it
was better for a mind like his, so fair and penetrating
and judicial, to be left largely to feel its own way to the
truth. So I have made no formal effort to commend our
own faith to him—save by shaping my inquiries of
Miriam and our talks with each other so as to furnish
answers to questions which a great and philosophic mind
would naturally ask on its way to a just conviction.
Have I been right in this?”</p>

<p>“I think so,” she answered. “Such men, my father
says, must convince themselves. The most we can do is
to get the material for judgment within their reach.
And I think we have done this successfully in the case of
my grandfather. His mind is open to evidence from all
quarters. He has no national or race prejudices. He<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_363" id="Page_363">[363]</a></span>
married a Caucasian princess; and was willing that my
mother should marry a Hebrew. Signs are not wanting
to me that his judgment is slowly but surely settling in
favor of Jesus, not only as a divine messenger, but even
as an incarnation of the One God. And yet I do not
think that he has any idea of relinquishing his position
as primate of the Egyptians.”</p>

<p>“I see no reason why he should,” returned Aleph.
“He holds the original Egyptian position in matters of
faith; also that of the higher priesthood all through the
Egyptian history. He fairly represents the religion of
the land as it was when his office was established: his
predecessors have wrongfully used their power to change
the ancient faith and practice; he can rightfully use his
power to restore it. Meanwhile, he is acting no part; he
is perfectly frank and outspoken as to his views and objects;
his function requires of him no endorsement of
idolatry or even a refusal of the Hebrew Scriptures and
their Messiah. He could, to-day, say to his College of
Priests, not only that, like the far-back fathers, he believes
in one Infinite God who only is to be worshipped
with Divine honors, but also that he believes that this
God has just appeared in the person of Jesus—he could
freely say all this and his subordinate priests would not
be stumbled. So I think that no law, human or divine,
requires him to surrender the advantages of his position
in favor of some one who would promote the national
apostasy instead of reforming it.... But I could wish
to see him pronounced in favor of Jesus before I leave
the country.”</p>

<p>“That, I trust, will not be soon?” said Rachel, with
a startled look.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_364" id="Page_364">[364]</a></span></p>

<p>“As soon as these trials are fairly over, I suppose.”</p>

<p>“What!” she exclaimed with a look of dismay, “I
thought you would remain a long time, studying our institutions,
enlarging your knowledge of the Western
World, especially getting an inside view of our University
life and teachings. Be persuaded to remain—a long,
very long time. Seti had rather lose all the rest of the
University. I do not think he could be persuaded to
part with you at all. And I think,” she stammered,
“all your friends here feel very much the same.”</p>

<p>He replied, “My father did not propose for me a long
stay in this city. Through my Greek preceptor I was already
considerably acquainted with the matters you mention.
They have been merely collaterals to two main
purposes—which were, first, to learn what could be
learned about the Messiah who, as my father believed,
was born at Bethlehem some thirty years ago; and,
second, to investigate the proceedings of Malus. As side
issues my father wished me to get such improvement as
a young man might from seeing the world, and from being
under the necessity of judging and acting for himself
among all sorts of men and under all sorts of conditions.
And as soon as the great objects of my visit could be accomplished
he wished me to return. I am an only child:
the father wishes to see his son, and the son wishes to see
the father. And if I can return through Judea and see
the Messiah, and carry away from him to my parents a
blessing, I shall consider my mission accomplished. But
it will cost me something—very much indeed—to go
away, even though it be homeward. I never expected to
find such friends in Alexandria as I have found; and, as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_365" id="Page_365">[365]</a></span>
the day approaches for me to say farewell to them, I find
I am approaching one of the greatest trials of my life.
What wonderful kindness they have shown the nameless
stranger who could not, consistently with his father’s
wishes, furnish the commonest letter of introduction!
And what delightful hours have I spent in this house
with one whose views and feelings on the most important
of all subjects have harmonized so completely with my
own! Yes, it will cost me much to go away—I did not
know how much till I received yesterday a letter of recall
from my father (his lip quivered); and I doubt whether
I have even now a full sense of the bitterness that will
come in saying last words. But, if they must be said, it
is doubtless better that they be said a week hence than at
some remoter time. I feel that my heart is less and less
under my control with every passing day. You see (he
added with a sad smile) that, if there were no other reasons,
I must go away to escape from you: Rachel is too
mighty for Aleph the Chaldean. When one cannot conquer
it is best to leave the field.”</p>

<p>“Flight is disgraceful,” exclaimed Rachel with
sparkling eyes. “Better die on the field. But I will be
merciful to my captive. He shall live.”</p>

<p>“To be dragged at your chariot wheels—to grace the
triumph of her at whose feet lies the empire of the
West?” He rose.</p>

<p>She also rose and came toward him. “You are quoting;
or you are thinking of a distant somebody of whom
you have heard and whom you have despised. Surely
you are not thinking of <em>me</em>. It is true, if I must say
it, that I have been offered the Roman purple in the person
of the heir-apparent; and that to-day the elders of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_366" id="Page_366">[366]</a></span>
my people have been here to urge my acceptance of the
proposals—for the public good. I listened to what they
had to say and was silent—following the counsel of my
grandfather. But to you I will not be silent. I have
never seen Germanicus, and never want to see him. The
empire of the West will have to wait long at my feet before
I take it up. I will have none of it. I had rather
die.”</p>

<p>She hesitated a moment and then went on, while a
celestial blush spread a new loveliness over every feature,
“So you see that you need not go away to escape from
me. The daughter of Alexander was glad, beyond measure,
to hear that she was beloved by Aleph the Chaldean.
She accepts his love and gives him as large in return.”</p>

<p>Even Aleph could be transfigured. And it was nothing
less than a transfiguration that now took place in his
face at this frank declaration. Rachel had seen that face
in many moods of thoughtfulness, watchfulness, resolve,
pity, gratitude, command; but she had never before seen
it radiant with joy. Now she saw it—wonderingly and
blissfully saw it. All the flood gates of the morning
seemed suddenly opened in his face. Such eloquence
beamed upon her from that illuminated page that she
needed no voice to interpret it. But a voice came—with
a curious accent of surprise and inquiry.</p>

<p>“Can it be that I hear aright? Can it be that the
greatest good fortune of my life thus far has come to me
to-day; and that the maiden for whose favor princes
strive can give her heart and hand to one who is to her
merely Aleph the Chaldean—the unknown?”</p>

<p>“You are <em>not</em> unknown,” she replied with a face as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_367" id="Page_367">[367]</a></span>
radiant and transfigured as his own. “It is true that I
do not know whether you are rich or poor, whether
prince or peasant, but this I know, that in yourself alone
you deserve the warmest love that woman can give; and
I give it. You shall be my emperor.”</p>

<p>“What will Seti say?”</p>

<p>“He will say as I do—proud old Pharaoh as he is.”</p>

<p>“What will your father say—the rich, the ambitious?”</p>

<p>“He will say as Seti says till he comes to know you
better; and then he will say as I do. Much as he values
money, I happen to know that he values merit more.”</p>

<p>“What will the city say? That the Gem of Alexandria,
who might have chosen the greatest and best in the
land, and even been mistress of the West, has thrown
herself away on a nameless adventurer?”</p>

<p>“Perhaps. But I do not propose to marry to suit
the city.”</p>

<p>In a moment she found herself in his arms, and felt
his warm, lingering lips on her forehead. She looked up
at him archly and said:</p>

<p>“And what will <em>your</em> father say?”</p>

<p>“Ah, that is a very serious question!” he answered
with a smile; “but fortunately I can answer it better to-day
than I could have done yesterday. This morning I
saw Cimon, and, on my telling him my feelings toward
you, he surprised me by saying that it was my father’s
hope that during my absence I might find among the
chosen people some suitable maiden to share my lot and
be to him a daughter—that his wandering Jacob might
somewhere find a Rachel. And Cimon, from whom I
have kept nothing, is satisfied—nay, more, is delighted.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_368" id="Page_368">[368]</a></span>
So thus I answer your question. My father will say as
Cimon does, and Cimon will say as I do.”</p>

<p>How long Aleph tarried at this unwatered wine I do
not know; but I happen to know that he did not become
so intoxicated but that he could hold a long business consultation
afterward with Piso and Seti about the trials
that were to begin the next day.</p>

<p>He was driving the chariot of the sun; but he held
the fiery coursers well in hand.</p>

<h3>XVI.<br />
<span class="smaller">THE BASILICA.</span></h3>

<p>The courts of Alexandria were held in the great
Basilica at the intersection of Emporium Street
with the Street of Canopus.</p>

<p>Among the Romans, subject peoples were, as far as
possible, left to be governed by their own laws and customs.
Accordingly all suits between persons of the
same nation were first tried by their own judges. An
appeal could be taken from these to a Roman court.
Also, the case went to a Roman court if the judges failed
to agree on a verdict.</p>

<p>The suit of Malus against the two brothers, Shaphan
and Nathan, for the non-payment of the sum they had
agreed to give for his rights in their khan-business,
together with interest on the same for nearly thirty years
(time did not outlaw debts in Alexandria), being between
Jew and Jew, came before Jewish judges, who happened
to be equally divided between the two chief synagogues.</p>

<p>In suits of this kind, and indeed of almost every kind,
it was customary for the more immediate friends of
either party to give him moral support by taking seat
with him in the court-room. Of course Malus was not
unprovided with sympathizers. Nor were Shaphan and
Nathan. On their side of the room sat Seti and Aleph,
as well as some of the principal men of the Diapleuston.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_372" id="Page_372">[372]</a></span></p>

<p>I do not propose to give a detailed account of proceedings.
Those who are curious about the formalities of
ancient courts, Jewish or Roman, must seek for them in
other works. I touch only <i lang="la">fastigia verum</i>.</p>

<p>The advocate of Malus first stated briefly the accusation.
Then Malus made oath that the statement was
correct. Next the defendants made oath to the contrary.
Then Piso, as advocate for the defendants, proceeded to
question Malus. Was it not possible that he had long
ago received payment, but had gradually, through press
of affairs of much greater consequence, lost sight of the
fact? Malus replied that he was not apt to be forgetful in
business matters: besides, he distinctly remembered having
made an annual application in writing at the beginning
of each year for the sum due him, to say nothing of many
personal applications. He was prepared to furnish witnesses
to the fact of such applications, both written and
oral, during a full quarter of a century.</p>

<p>Piso inquired why he had not brought suit before.
Malus replied that he had not been pressed for money;
but that the leading motive for his long delay had been
<em>mercy</em>. He hated to push matters to extremities; but
had at last come, very reluctantly, to feel that forbearance
with such unscrupulous persons was no longer a
virtue, but rather an encouragement to wrong-doing.</p>

<p>Here his advocate suggested that he probably was in
the habit of giving a receipt for moneys paid him.</p>

<p>“I <em>always</em> do it,” he said promptly. “Of course a
receipt is always expected and demanded in case of large
payments. If the defendants had paid me the money
due they would have demanded a receipt and I should
have given it. Let them produce my receipt.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_373" id="Page_373">[373]</a></span></p>

<p>Malus indulged himself with what he meant for a
smile, which was broadly imitated by his party.</p>

<p>“Do you recognize this?” inquired Piso, producing a
discolored sheet of papyrus, and handing it to Malus.
The man’s hand visibly trembled as he took it; and as his
eye glanced along the page he could not prevent a ripple of
dismay from passing across his features. But it was gone
in an instant.</p>

<p>“A very clever forgery!” he sneered.</p>

<p>Piso took back the paper and handed it to the judges,
together with some letters which he himself had received
from Malus in course of years on business matters.</p>

<p>“The honorable judges will perceive,” said he, after
a few moments had been allowed for a comparison of the
papers, “that if the receipt is a forgery, it is an exceedingly
clever one—perhaps will perceive that it is so clever
that none but an expert scribe, who has made a close
study of the plaintiff’s handwriting in many specimens,
could possibly have done it. This is what the leading
scribes in the city tell me, and are here to testify. But
Shaphan and Nathan are <em>not</em> skillful scribes—as you may
see from these specimens received from them in course of
business,”—and he passed over to the judges a parcel.</p>

<p>After a few moments he resumed. “But the honorable
judges should further notice that the receipt bears
the signatures of two witnesses, as was customary years
ago in transactions of such magnitude. These witnesses
have given me some trouble. They left the city shortly
after signing this document, and I could not find any
one who knew where they were. The probability was
that they were dead; for they were not young when they
disappeared, and thirty years make havoc with old people.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_374" id="Page_374">[374]</a></span>
But yesterday, without concert and from opposite directions,
they for the first time returned to the city—each
drawn by a mysterious feeling that he was wanted and
<em>must</em> not stay away. They are in this room now; can
be identified by persons here present who formerly knew
them well; will testify to their own signatures, and anew
to the well-remembered fact that Malus received his
money in their presence.”</p>

<p>Turning again to Malus, Piso said, “You say that
this receipt is a forgery—to whom do you attribute the
forgery?”</p>

<p>“Of course to those who could hope for advantage
from it—to Shaphan and Nathan.”</p>

<p>“The honorable judges and all here present will
please notice,” exclaimed Piso, “that Malus has publicly
charged my clients with the crime of forgery; a charge
which I deny in their name, against which their general
repute testifies, and for which I propose to bring suit
against him at fitting opportunity. He shall <em>prove</em> what
he now asserts, or suffer the penalty prescribed by law to
false accusers. Meanwhile, my clients are held innocent
by the law as not yet having been proved guilty; and
this case must be decided on the assumption that they
have <em>not</em> committed a forgery.”</p>

<p>Of course the advocate on the other side was voluble
and shrewd. He had not practiced in the school of Malus
many years in vain; but had his ways of making the
worse appear the better—pushing some things to the
front, others to the rear; throwing a shadow here and a
glare there; slurring over this and dwelling on that;
magnifying little things and dwarfing great ones—all
after the manner of unscrupulous advocates in every age<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_375" id="Page_375">[375]</a></span>
The result was that the four judges were equally divided—the
Diapleuston pair deciding for the brothers, the
others for Malus. So the case went the next day to the
Roman Court held in another room of the same Basilica.</p>

<p>Malus was not discouraged by this. He counted on
the Flaccan influence being in his favor; and, quite as
much, on his reputation of being on good terms with the
Roman authorities. He hoped to see some Romans of
standing, who might be supposed inspired by Flaccus,
occupying seats on his side of the house; also to get from
the judges, as they came in and took their seats, some
furtive glances of recognition and encouragement. He
was disappointed. Still, official people have to be prudent
in showing their favoritism; and he still hoped that the
powerful magnates at Bruchium were surely, though
secretly, at work for him.</p>

<p>The case was reviewed, the arguments for and against
were repeated without material change, the same testimonies
were given as before—save that Piso was now able to
bring forward witnesses to show that, when his clients
informed Malus of the loss of the receipt and asked for
another, he did not deny having given one, but deferred
giving a duplicate just then because of press of business.</p>

<p>The verdict was against the plaintiff.</p>

<p>Malus was astonished at this unusual experience. It
was a blow at his prestige. There was no telling but that
other victims of his craft and greed, encouraged by this
defeat, might turn upon him. Also, it looked as though
his Roman friends were beginning to fail him. Still, he
was a man of audacity; had grown into a vast confidence
in himself and his star; believed more in Simon Magus
and his pleasing predictions than in God and eternal<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_376" id="Page_376">[376]</a></span>
justice: moreover, he said to himself that the Romans in
this small matter were trying to appear impartial, so as
to break the force of public criticism and suspicion when
they should come to decide for him in the larger matters
pending. So he managed to keep up heart. Does not
many a bright day begin in clouds? Has not many a
victory been introduced by a check?</p>

<p>The next day brought on his suit against Cimon the
Greek—to be tried in the same place, before the same
Judges and Prætor. He was on the ground very early,
with an enlarged body of sympathizers and a cheerful
aspect. His friends copied his example, and beat the
copy. They were almost hilarious. They thought that
it would help to gain a battle, to assume it to be already
gained. The real object of Malus, however, in being at
the Basilica considerably in advance of time, was to get,
if possible, an opportunity to convey a note, or a word,
through some sub-official of the court, to one or more of
the judges before they took their seats. This he was able
to do; for he made it worth the while for janitors and
pursuivants to oblige him.</p>

<p>When the Prætor and Judges came in he watched
their faces for some auspicious sign. But they were still
very prudent—unnecessarily so, he thought. In his
heart he cursed them for it. It was carrying matters quite
too far. They might at least give him a glance that
would mean much to him while not compromising them.
But they did not even look his way. He would make
them sweat for it some day.</p>

<p>Cimon, whom we have not seen for too many days, had
come in escorted by two officers; whom, however, he
seemed escorting. Seated near him were, not only Seti<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_377" id="Page_377">[377]</a></span>
and Aleph, but also Alexander, who had arrived from
Rome during the last night, together with a large delegation
from the Diapleuston Seventy. This was not a
pleasant sight to Malus: but it was a relief, as he
looked about from under his bushy eyebrows, to see seated
with his own company several Roman officers well known
as the intimates of Sextus Flaccus. “It is all right,”
said he to himself. “It is all wrong,” said the thoughts
on the other side of the house—with a few exceptions.
These exceptions said, “<em>The Lord reigneth</em>; I will not
fear what man can do to me.”</p>

<p>According to custom, the court opened with an outline-statement
from the advocate of the plaintiff. The
defendant had visited the warehouse of Malus, was shown
by his conductor through the department of eastern
goods, was observed to notice particularly the jewels.
Soon after he left, and before any other person had come
in, the young man who had conducted him, becoming
disturbed as he thought of the suspicious appearance of
the stranger, returned to the jewelry room and found a
certain casket, containing gems worth fifty thousand
<i>aurei</i>, to be missing. Whereupon Malus set inquiries on
foot, found out where the stranger lodged, obtained a
search warrant, found the casket hidden in his room but
empty, and had him arrested for theft. His client
would say whether this statement was correct.</p>

<p>According to custom, Malus made oath that the facts
were as stated—made oath “by Him who reigns in
Heaven”; for such was the blanket oath that could be
taken alike by the man who believed in Jupiter, or in
Zeus, or in Osiris, or in Jehovah.</p>

<p>Then Piso outlined his defense. “Some facts had been<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_378" id="Page_378">[378]</a></span>
correctly stated. Cimon did visit the warehouse, was
conducted through the jewelry department, did notice
the cabinet of jewels in passing. Also, the casket was
seemingly found in his room. But <em>he</em> did not carry it
there. That was done by the agent of Malus who conducted
the searching party, in order to make out a case
against Cimon, whom Malus had reason to fear and wished
to discredit and remove. His client would say whether
the facts had been correctly stated.”</p>

<p>Cimon made oath that, to the best of his belief, the
facts were as stated.</p>

<p>Omitting the plea for the plaintiff which came next,
the witness-bearing on both sides, the questionings and
cross-questionings by the advocates, I will give a summary
of Piso’s plea, which came last.</p>

<p>He began with gravely ridiculing the idea that anything
in the appearance of Cimon should have suggested
to his conductor that he was a thief. “The Judges can
see for themselves that the story is incredible. So far as
appearances go, there is not a man here less likely to do
what has been charged upon him than Cimon, the Greek.
Further, it appears from the testimony of the Alabarch
that this man, whose face is written all over with the
natural marks of honesty and high character, has a credit
with him for 200,000 gold staters; and so is a very
unlikely person to steal what might be, as everybody
knows, a box of sham jewels, or even an empty box.
Further, the Superintendent of the jewelry department
has testified that he saw the casket in its place after
Cimon had left; and it cannot be claimed that he gave
this testimony in revenge for his dismissal from his post,
because he brought me the information before the dismissal<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_379" id="Page_379">[379]</a></span>
took place. Further, the young man called Aleph
the Chaldean, and a much esteemed member of the University,
has testified that he was present when the search
was made, and actually saw the Cretan agent of Malus
furtively slip the casket from the bosom of his own tunic
as he pretended to grope for it on his knees in the dimmer
part of the room: and the Cretan himself, at last
tired of the wickedness he has been set to do, and fearing
the avenging heavens and his own awaking conscience,
has confessed that such was the fact—that Malus
had employed him to play that part, and, lest he should
be tempted to run away with the casket, had opened it in
his presence and showed that it was empty, instead of
containing gems to the value of 50,000 staters.</p>

<p>“The advocate on the other side has asked what possible
motive could Malus have for attacking maliciously a
stranger who had never crossed his plans, or even his
path, till a few days ago. That point was well taken.
People do not act without motive, and what seems to
them a sufficient motive: and it is incredible that so
shrewd a man as Malus should lay a plot to brand Cimon
as a thief, and shut him up in prison, and, in default of
50,000 staters, sell him into slavery, without some powerful
reason for doing it. And such reason exists. The
plaintiff had become aware that Cimon had unearthed a
gigantic system of embezzlement on his part which
threatened to destroy his reputation, subject him to
heavy punishments, and sacrifice a large part, if not the
whole, of his fortune. To prevent this ruin he contrived
this plan to smutch Cimon as a low criminal whose
accusation was unworthy of notice—also to remove him
from view and possibility of action, first by incarceration,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_380" id="Page_380">[380]</a></span>
and then by sale into some distant servitude, as our laws
permit in case of insolvent debtors. All this will be
proved when the next suit in order shall come before the
court.</p>

<p>“As this last is evidently a vital point, the Prætor and
Judges, might do well to consider whether it would not be
well to reserve their decision of this case until after the
suit of Cimon against Malus has been tried. They can
safely be promised great additional light.”</p>

<p>Such, for substance, was what Piso said in a much
enlarged form. Strong opposition was made to his proposal
for postponement by the Malus party; but, after a
good deal of mutual consultation on the part of the
Prætor and Judges, and, as the day was already far spent,
it was at length decided to reserve the decision in hope of
additional light on the morrow.</p>

<p>Malus was now thoroughly roused. Under the
stolid and uninterpretable exterior with which he retired
from the Basilica everything was ablaze—all his shrewdness,
all his determination, all his wrath, all his daring.
He was a born gambler, and could coolly stake everything
on a last throw. To-morrow he <em>must</em> conquer.
To-morrow he <em>would</em> conquer. The stars should fulfill
themselves by fighting for him. Simon should weave
his spells and summon his mightiest spirits all the live-long
night in his behalf. But he would not neglect to
supplement magic with all the human expedients for
winning success. He had prospered so long that he had
come to feel that prosperity was both his destiny and his
due. He had made people his prey so long that they
seemed <em>made</em> to be victimized: he had the right of a
fisherman to draw into his net as many fishes as possible<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_381" id="Page_381">[381]</a></span>
by all possible ways and means. He had used the right
freely, made many captures, and hitherto had not found
a captive large enough to break through his net. He
determined that his steady run of good luck should not
fail him. He spent the whole night with his lawyer—trying
to forecast the course of accusation and evidence
which the other party would take, and the best ways of
resisting the same. Among these ways he decided
should be a more decided and potent invoking of his
Roman friends to come to his aid. He thoroughly
believed in the venality of every Roman, from the governor
downward or upward. Some could be bought for
less than others—but all could be bought. Perhaps his
hints had not been sufficiently broad: perhaps he had
not hinted at sums sufficiently large in the case of some.
Now he would mend all that. The governor should have
an offer that he could not misunderstand; and one that
even a governor would find it worth his while to accept.
So of the city Prætor and Judges. Each should have his
gratification, and a large one. It would be costly work:
but then he could easily and swiftly reimburse himself if
his situation could be made secure. Such was his confidence,
after all, in the sympathy of the authorities and
in the power of money that he was able to face the new
day with untrembling nerves, despite the vigils of the
night. Had not trusty messengers gone in all directions
with instructions to make all sure, <em>sure</em>—regardless of expense?</p>

<p>The Basilica was crowded long before the hour. Malus
had with him all his friends of the day before, and, in addition,
the leading men of his synagogue. On the other
side, besides those of the day before, was a large delegation<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_382" id="Page_382">[382]</a></span>
from the University, with Philo and Cornelius at
their head—also a large number of by no means showy
people, apparently small traders and shop-keepers, whose
“moral support” the students seemed at first inclined to
laugh at, but, at a hint from Piso, ended in making much
of. Among these last was the Phenician of Chapter Second,
sitting between his Cretan oppressor and Malus’s
discharged clerk. It is doubtful whether Malus recognized
these persons—they were well in the rear; and besides
he deigned only a glance at the nobodies, being on
the lookout for only somebodies, for people of station and
weight and large consideration. Of this class he as yet
saw no addition to the other side, save the students; and
them he was prepared to see.</p>

<p>It was now almost time for the court to open, when an
unusual stir was heard at the main door of the Basilica;
and shortly the Governor made his appearance, attended
by several sub-officials and supporting his son Sextus.
The young man was very pale, leaned hard on his father,
and, before he had advanced far, became faint and motioned
toward the first vacant seats they came to—which
chanced to be on Malus’s side of the house. Accordingly,
the party fell in there, and busied themselves in trying
most officiously to help the invalid—offering this and that
restorative, making this and that inquiry, and generally
making him as miserable as they could well do by shutting
off from him air and light and quiet.</p>

<p>Malus was overjoyed. Plainly his last move had been
a successful one. The powers had at last shown their
hand. Now he was <em>sure</em> what the result of the trial would
be. He shot a glance of triumph at Piso; and was in the
act of rising to go and pay his respects to his excellency<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_383" id="Page_383">[383]</a></span>
and offer his services toward making the sick man still
more uncomfortable, when the voice of the crier was
heard, loudly demanding order and announcing the opening
of the court. He looked at the tribunal. The Prætor
and Judges were already in their places. So the best he
could do was to throw toward his Roman friends, so opportunely
arrived, as much of a mingled look of concern
and sympathy and welcome as his wooden face would
permit.</p>

<p>According to Roman forms, the advocate of the plaintiff
first stated briefly his accusation. Some thirty years
ago a merchant from Chaldea visited the city; made Malus
his agent for the sale of certain costly goods to be sent to
him from time to time; and, from that time to this, made
frequent and heavy consignments—at first satisfactorily,
but with growing dissatisfaction as the years went on, on
account of the smallness of the returns; this smallness
being ascribed by Malus partly to losses in transit from
shipwreck and robberies, partly to enormous custom-house
exactions, and partly to poor markets. Finally, the suspicions
of the merchant became so strong that he sent his
friend Cimon to Alexandria to make inquiries and to take
such action as his representative as should seem fitting.
Inquiries had shown that the statements of Malus were
false at all points—the receipts which he had given as harbor-master
show that all the goods sent have been received
in good condition; the registers of the custom house,
which his excellency the Governor has allowed to be examined,
show that only a part of the goods received have
been entered for duty, and that the duty actually paid on
the part entered has been far less than reported (as also
appears from the testimony of the chief of the custom<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_384" id="Page_384">[384]</a></span>
house): finally, the testimony of the leading houses engaged
in the eastern trade, including that of Malus himself,
shows that the market price for nearly all the thirty
years has been far higher than Malus has reported. Proof
of all these statements would be submitted at the proper
time. In view of them it appears that Malus is indebted
to Cimon, the agent, in the sum of one million gold
staters, exclusive of the interest which the law allows in
such cases. The Judges could now see why Malus could
wish to discredit Cimon as a low criminal and remove
both him and his companion from the scene. It was to
discredit and, if possible, prevent a suit that threatened
him with ruin of both fortune and reputation.</p>

<p>Did the plaintiff accept these statements as correct?
Cimon accepted.</p>

<p>Then the advocate of Malus briefly denied the charge,
and stated as chief points of the defense—that the harbor-receipts,
beyond those for goods actually found registered
at the custom house, are forgeries; that what purported
to be Malus’s accounts to his Chaldean principal of exorbitant
duties and poor markets were also forgeries; that
very many of his accounts and remittances had been ignored;
that, instead of owing the Chaldean anything, he
had dealt with him on a principle of large liberality, and
had paid him considerably more than he could equitably
claim. He expected to show that his client was the object
of a great conspiracy—that people whom nobody
knew, whose very names were fictitious, and who certainly
had no visible standing and reliability, had conspired
to rob and ruin a man of the first standing; and
had craftily taken advantage of old feuds and religious
differences to secure abettors. The case was really one<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_385" id="Page_385">[385]</a></span>
between the allegations of nobodies and those of a prominent
and honored citizen.</p>

<p>Did the defendant accept these statements? Malus
accepted.</p>

<p>Here Sextus Flaccus struggled to his feet, and with
the help of his father and the well-meant hindrance of
the other Romans about him, feebly and slowly made his
way to the opposite benches. Malus was yet standing
and saw every movement. He had just finished one
oath—and he felt like taking another. It was with difficulty
that he commanded himself enough to sink quietly
into his seat. What could this mean? Had his agents
betrayed him? Had the stars, and the magic spells, and
the mighty demons, and even Avilleus Flaccus at last
failed him? He was almost stunned by the sudden fall
from the heights of confidence to the depths of discouragement.</p>

<p>As soon as the room was again quiet, Piso produced
his documents and witnesses. After these had been canvassed
by both parties, Piso proceeded to sum up for
Cimon somewhat after this manner:</p>

<p>“It is a very easy thing to cry ‘forgery’ and ‘conspiracy.’
Anybody can do that, provided he has no conscience.
I demand that my client be <em>proved</em> a forger and
conspirator. Until that is done he has a legal right to
be considered innocent.</p>

<p>“I happened to foresee what course the defense
would take, and so was very glad to meet, yesterday,
in the city, the Superintendent of Customs at Myos
Hermos. This man, who has held his post for more
than forty years, and is well known to the authorities
here as reliable beyond question, has testified that all the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_386" id="Page_386">[386]</a></span>
parcels of goods which we claim to have been sent from
the East were duly received and recorded at his port, and
thence forwarded to Alexandria, and acknowledged by
Malus as harbor-master. This settles the matter. Malus
has received in good condition all the goods sent him—his
sworn denials and charges of forgery to the contrary
notwithstanding.</p>

<p>“Just here I call the attention of the Judges to a
noteworthy fact: we did not send for this venerable witness
from Myos Hermos. Though we thought of him
and wanted him, we knew that we could not bring him
in time for the trial. How, then, does it happen that
he is here so opportunely? You have heard his explanation.
He had no particular business of his own to draw
him to the city, nor was he aware of the present suit;
only he felt pressed and drawn to be here on a certain
day by a mysterious influence which he was afraid to
resist. It looks as if the very Heavens themselves were
concerned to have justice done in this case.</p>

<p>“We have seen that Malus received, in good condition,
all the goods sent. Only one question remains:
Has he duly accounted for them all to his principal?
The accounts which have been submitted to the Court—accounts
apparently in his own handwriting, and which
leading experts pronounce to be genuine—say No. They
say that many parcels have never been received; that
others came to hand in a damaged condition; that the
duties on almost all received were much larger and the
market-prices much smaller than the actual. But Malus
declares that these accounts are not genuine: they are
clever counterfeits, gotten up for the purpose of robbing
and ruining him. The accounts which he actually sent<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_387" id="Page_387">[387]</a></span>
were very different, and correctly represent duties and
prices and everything. All this he simply asserts. He
makes no attempt to <em>prove</em> his assertion: and I might
well content myself with a simple counter-assertion. But
I will not do this. He says that he has sent to the East,
accounts correct in every particular, which have been
suppressed. To this I answer that all such accounts,
with remittances, imply as many acknowledgments from
the receiver. No merchant here, least of all Malus, would
go on sending accounts with moneys, year after year for
thirty years, without getting acknowledgments for the
same in the handwriting of the receiver or his authorized
proxy. Let Malus produce such acknowledgments. He
cannot do it. He has none to present.</p>

<p>“But Malus alleges that the case is one of contest of
reputations. It is the assertion of a Nobody against the
denial of a Somebody. The word of an unknown foreigner
ought not to have any weight against the word of
that eminent citizen and saint whom everybody in Alexandria
knows, and knows to be full of riches and honors
and virtues—the man who has never wronged anybody;
has never ground the faces of the poor; has never sought
to take advantage of Shaphan the Jew, or Athon the
Phenician, or Epimetes the Greek, or Plautus the Roman,
or anybody else under the wide heaven. Here,
behind me, are a few of the people he has dealt with,
ready to testify that Malus is not the sort of man to commit
smuggling, to swear falsely, or even to be less than
most merciful to those in his power! Would Malus like
to hear from some of his victims?”</p>

<p>On this Sextus Flaccus rose, and slowly, with feeble
voice and many a pause, proceeded to say that <em>he</em> was a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_388" id="Page_388">[388]</a></span>
victim, though not an innocent one. No doubt many
were surprised to see him there, and still more surprised
to see him in that part of the room. All Alexandria
knew that he had long been intimate with Malus, and
must know not a little of his principles and practices.
Indeed he had, he was ashamed to say, to a certain extent
shared in them. What sort of life he had lived, disgraceful
to himself and his friends, was notorious. It was not
necessary for him to specify—he would spare himself that
pain. But this he must say, that in all his follies and
sins he was always encouraged and often prompted by
Malus. His intemperance, his violence, his enmities, had
always been fanned by that man to the utmost.</p>

<p>Without any help from Malus, he had been very hostile
to Cimon the Greek, and Aleph the Chaldean. The
latter had hurt his pride, and so humbled him in the
presence of others that he burned for revenge. Malus
whetted his passion, and prompted him to measures for
gratifying it which, bad as he was, he would not otherwise
have thought of.</p>

<p>“Malus proposed,” continued Sextus, after pausing
to recover breath, “that we make common cause against
the two men. He told me frankly what reason he had
to fear them, and dwelt artfully on the reasons I had for
being revenged upon them. He tried to make me feel
that we had a common interest in humbling and suppressing
them. He plied me with wine. This and the
violence of my passions for a while carried me away and
made me a ready tool in his hands.</p>

<p>“But I have changed my mind. I have been at
death’s door; and the light that came to me from behind
it has shown me three things: my own folly and guilt,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_389" id="Page_389">[389]</a></span>
the utterly unscrupulous character of my tempter, and
the thorough goodness of at least one of the men (and
presumably of his friend and preceptor) whom we had
been seeking to injure—may Heaven forgive me, as he
has done! To him I owe my life and an opportunity to
mend my ways. We had sought to dishonor him, and
he knew it. We had done our worst to give him a felon’s
name and fate, and he knew it. And yet he delivered
me from my enemies, rescued me from death, nursed
back my flickering life with the carefulness of a mother.
I will tell the whole painful story, if Malus chooses to
have me; but it would be to his disadvantage as well as
to my shame. I propose, Heaven helping me, to mend
my ways after thus publicly confessing the sin of them.
I advise Malus to do the same.”</p>

<p>Sextus sank into his seat exhausted. The silence that
followed for a few moments thundered. What eyes were
not turned on Aleph were fastened on Malus. But the
wooden face said nothing; only the wood was several
shades darker than usual.</p>

<p>Piso resumed: “The testimony we have just heard is
as weighty as it was unexpected. What Sextus Flaccus
has now said about the principles and practices of Malus
has long been said under breath by great numbers who
have dealt with him. It is well understood in the city
that Malus is not a man to stop at any safe way of accomplishing
his purposes of gain, or any other purposes. A
whole army of victims would appear against him, if it
could be understood that it would be safe to do so—would
have appeared long ago but for the conviction
that the monster that devours them is too big a monster
and too well fenced by his scales to be successfully attacked,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_390" id="Page_390">[390]</a></span>
or even complained of. He is the successor of
the Lernean Hydra, from whom all but Hercules felt
compelled to hide.</p>

<p>“This is the eminent citizen who thinks that nameless
Nobodies ought not to have their testimony taken as
against him. I admit that Cimon the Greek and Aleph
the Chaldean were strangers here a few days ago, and are
still strangers to most of our people. And yet they have
found means so to introduce themselves to the confidence
of some of our most honorable citizens that these citizens
are willing to vouch for them: in which case they
stand before the law and the public with all the prestige
of their sponsors.</p>

<p>“But I am unwilling to have my clients rest their
claim to respectability and consideration on the dignity
of any other people, however high, who are willing to
vouch for them. It is unnecessary. They have an honorable
standing of their own. It is written in their very
faces and bearing. Who is Cimon the Greek? It appears
from this certified copy of the records of the University
that thirty years ago a young man with that name
and of illustrious Athenian descent greatly distinguished
himself above all his companions in all branches of learning
and gentlemanly accomplishment. This young man
is Cimon the Greek—as two of the older teachers in the
University have been able to recognize and are here to
testify.</p>

<p>“And who is Aleph the Chaldean? You have only
to look upon him to know that he is <em>Somebody</em>: how
much of a body, so far as social standing is concerned,
this packet which I now take up from the table ought to
tell. Those of you who sit near me can see that the seal<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_391" id="Page_391">[391]</a></span>
is yet unbroken. I now break it; and, on removing certain
wraps, come to this” (he held up to view a roll of
vellum richly blazoned and bearing a broad seal). “This
document is bordered with many jewels, the value of
which some of you can judge of better than myself, but
which yet my limited knowledge of such matters assures
me to be quite great enough to authenticate the written
contents. So costly a credential as this is beyond the
reach of an impostor, and was doubtless chosen for this
reason. What are the contents?”</p>

<p>He paused, and read in silence. Then, holding up
the vellum so as to display the seal, he resumed:</p>

<p>“This seal bears on it the figure of a crown. The
script is in three languages—Latin, Greek, and Chaldean.
I will read the Greek:</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“<span class="smcap">To all whom it may concern</span>:</p>

<p>“‘I, Jasper Daniel Atropates, King of Median Atropatene
and pontiff of the Most High God, foreseeing that
occasion may arise for such a document as this, do hereby
certify that the bearer is my only son, Prince Aleph
Daniel, whom I send with his Greek preceptor and my
chief counsellor into Egypt for purposes altogether peaceful,
viz.: to study the institutions and learning of the
West, to enlarge his knowledge of life and man, and to
act for me, in conjunction with his companion, in all my
business affairs in that land.</p>

<p>“‘To this I affix the seal of my kingdom.’</p>

</div>

<p>“Such is the document,” said Piso, handing it to
the Judges for inspection. After a few moments he
resumed:</p>

<p>“In explanation of this document, I would remind<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_392" id="Page_392">[392]</a></span>
the Court that Atropatene is a Chaldean kingdom of
great beauty and fertility, unassailably entrenched among
the mountains of Media, where for five hundred years
have ruled the descendants of the Hebrew prophet Daniel,
to whom it was given by Cyrus the Persian, and to
whose descendant Atropates it was confirmed by Alexander
the Macedonian. The monarchs of this dynasty
have not thought it beneath themselves to do as did Solomon
the Magnificent—to engage in commerce with foreign
countries and make the superfluities of one land
supply the deficiencies of another. Accordingly, when,
thirty years ago, Jasper with two other princes passed
through the land, he arranged with Malus, then not so
well known as he is now, to receive and dispose of such
eastern goods as might be sent him by way of the Red
Sea, Myos Hermos, and Coptus. Malus did not know
that his employer was a sovereign: probably has never
known it till now. This is the man whom he has defrauded—trusting
that the remoteness of his principal
would secure him from detection. But the Heavens
have decreed against him—the Heavens which he seems
to have forgotten.”</p>

<p>The advocate of Malus made only a brief reply. He
dealt in generalities. He asserted and reasserted in many
forms, and with much strength of voice, the innocence
of his client. Whatever the appearances against him,
they were deceptive. To get at real facts we often have
to go below the seemings. Wise men have to be on their
guard against even their own senses. He would not condemn
the notable citizens and officials who had given
their support to the other side: at the same time, he
must be allowed to say that they have made a grave mistake.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_393" id="Page_393">[393]</a></span>
They have been misled by circumstantial evidence,
as many other intelligent and upright men have been.
He had no doubt but that they would some day see their
mistake, and be sorry for it. How would they like to
have their own reputations and fortunes fall a prey to
some plausible adventurer? He hoped that they would
never come to that; but it now looked as if no man’s
fortune, or even life, would henceforth be safe in Alexandria.
He trusted that the eminent Judges would see
the peril to which they and all people of consideration
are exposed, and, by their verdict, discourage attacks on
prominent men, to which envy and cupidity so strongly
tempt.</p>

<p>It would not be surprising if his client, amid the
pressure and anxieties of so large and varied business,
had sometimes made mistakes, sometimes been forgetful,
and even sometimes been overborne and distracted to the
point of irresponsible insanity. In such circumstances
he may have done things which, in his right mind, he
never would have done. In the conduct of great and
complicated affairs the strain on the mind is often very
great; and, for his part, he wondered that it did not
give way oftener than it did. He hoped that the Judges
would take these considerations into account in making
up their verdict; and would not ruin one of their own
citizens for the sake of a foreigner, whether prince or
peasant. A verdict against Malus would send a large
sum out of the country, never to return. Alexandria
would be impoverished for the sake of Chaldea.</p>

<p>So the case was submitted. The Judges conferred
among themselves for a few moments, and then one of
them spoke in a low tone to the Prætor.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_394" id="Page_394">[394]</a></span></p>

<p>The public crier summoned attention, and the Prætor
announced:</p>

<p>“I. The Judges have decided that the suit of Malus
against Cimon is unsustained, and order that the defendant,
discharged from custody, receive damages to the
amount of 50,000 staters, the estimated value of the
jewels said to have been stolen.</p>

<p>“II. Also, the Judges have decided that the suit of
Cimon against Malus is sustained; and order that the
latter pay to the former the arrears for thirty years as
determined by certain dealers in eastern goods, hereafter
to be designated, in view of the actual duties and prices
during that period, and counting as genuine both the
harbor receipts of Malus and his accounts to his principal
as they have been shown here.</p>

<p>“III. Also, it is ordered that Malus be taken into custody
until the payment now decreed has been made, and
until it has been legally determined whether he is guilty
of the crime of smuggling. <span class="smcap">Licitum est Decedere.</span>”</p>

<p>Aleph and Cimon were overwhelmed with congratulations.
The Governor pressed them to become his
guests and occupy a vacant palace at Bruchium; but
they excused themselves, and begged to be allowed to
return unceremoniously with Seti to the Serapeum.
They were unable, however, to return as inconspicuously
as they wished: for the delegation of students, with Cornelius
at their head, insisted on escorting them, and
cheering crowds gradually gathered about them, and
before they reached the temple they met nearly the whole
enthusiastic membership of the University, whom nothing
could prevent from rending the air and shaking the
city with cries of “<span class="smcap">Long live Aleph the Prince!</span>”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_395" id="Page_395">[395]</a></span></p>

<p>Who were they who said that poetical justice is <em>always</em>
done in this world? Ah, I remember—they were the
friends of Job. Who were they who said that poetical
justice is <em>never</em> done in actual life? No matter: whoever
said it smote facts in the face. I mean such facts as
are recorded in this chapter: also such as are recorded in
the Bible history of Joseph, but especially of Daniel the
prophet, the great ancestor of our Aleph, against whose
fortunes the floods of wrong not only surged in vain, but
floated them up to higher levels.</p>

<p>Under the sun, the race is not always to the swift,
nor the battle to the strong, nor bread to the wise, nor
riches to men of understanding, nor favor to men of
skill. Sometimes good men have to wait long for their
due—sometimes even into the next world. Of course,
sooner or later justice will be done. As sure as there is
a God in Heaven, justice <em>must</em> be done, sooner or later.
But we are always thankful when it is done <em>sooner</em>—when
a good man does not have to wait for his due till he
is dead; when some Daniels and Aleph-Daniels are not
only recompensed in the earth, but find the feet of justice
not so heavily weighted but that they can reach their
goal within a few days of the starting. The weak in faith
then thank God and take courage.</p>

<h3>XVII.<br />
<span class="smaller">THE CONCLUSION.</span></h3>

<p>Were it not for a most conspicuous example, now
and then, of large success in committing an enterprise
to God and then mightily trusting His Providence,
faith would lack a very desirable inspiration.</p>

<p>In the case of our Chaldean friends, the success was
very large indeed. As we all soon come to know, many
good enterprises end in complete failure. Only a few attain
complete success, and realize all they proposed to
themselves. Still fewer <em>surpass</em> their aim, and accomplish
far more than they expected or ventured to hope.
Yet such was the enterprise of Cimon and Aleph in Alexandria.</p>

<p>What had they proposed to themselves? To investigate
Malus, and bring him to justice; to gather reliable information
concerning Him who was born king of the Jews
and to whom the miraculous star had guided the Magian
sovereigns; to broaden and enrich the education of
Aleph, not only by giving him a wider outlook on the
world and humanity, but by throwing him, divested of
all the insignia and glamour of his rank, entirely on his
own resources for guidance and help in dealing with men
in new and difficult circumstances. All these objects had
been accomplished.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_400" id="Page_400">[400]</a></span></p>

<p>Within a few days from the close of the trial the
authorities had placed in the hands of Cimon the full
amount of his claim against Malus, together with interest
on all delayed payments. This, in itself, was not
sufficient to ruin the rogue financially. But he had already
drawn considerably on his resources in his attempt
to bribe the judges and secure the countenance of other
influential people: for they had not hesitated to take
silently his gifts though no equivalent was rendered.
But the greatest drain upon him came from another
quarter. Other victims of his rapacity, encouraged by
the result of Cimon’s suit, attacked him successfully;
and before long it seemed as if there would be no end to
the suits. Under these circumstances, Alexandria was
not much surprised, one fine morning, to hear that Malus
(latterly they had fallen into the way of calling him
Pessimus) was nowhere to be found—nor any of his remaining
assets. The guard set upon him was not incorruptible,
and he had disappeared between two days. No
one knew where he had gone. Some said to Ethiopia;
some said to Spain; some said to Marseilles in Gaul; and
some would have it that he had taken to the desert with
Draco. A few declared that he had committed suicide.
This last supposition, however, was considered extremely
improbable, on the ground that so shrewd a person would
not take the trouble to carry away with him goods which
he did not mean to use. There is no use for current
money of the merchant in Hades. Whatever supposition
was correct, it is certain that Malus never reappeared in
Alexandria.</p>

<p>But our friends had a still more important object in
coming to the commercial metropolis of the West. It<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_401" id="Page_401">[401]</a></span>
was to learn about Him who was born king of the Jews.
Some things they already knew from the Magi—that his
coming was divinely heralded and accompanied by supernatural
events, that his mission was a great and glorious
one, having significance for all nations. What had they
learned in addition? That the life which had opened so
grandly amid the ministries and songs of angels, and the
worship and gifts of star-led pilgrims, had come to a
still grander sequel—that into the glowing dawn had at
length come the sun in his strength; a mingled glory of
miracles and character and teaching such as never before
gathered about a single life—that Jesus is surely the
Messiah of the Sacred Books and their sufficient credential—that
this Messiah is not, as has been commonly
supposed, a secular warrior, conqueror, and king; but a
spiritual monarch ruling over willing hearts in the interest
of truth and righteousness, and whose victories are
salvations—that his mission in the world is one of humiliation
instead of exaltation, of suffering instead of pleasure,
of death instead of life; and that in dying he completed
a vicarious sacrifice for the sins of the world—also,
that to express the dignity of his being both the
prophets and himself use language which exalts him far
above angels and claims for him a Divine nature. To
know all this was a great gain, more than they had ventured
to hope. And if, on their way home, they should
be able to see the Messiah with their own eyes, witness
personally some wonderful work, and obtain for themselves
and theirs his personal benediction, they would
feel that their way had been wonderfully prospered.</p>

<p>And then the educational object which the father of
Aleph distinctly proposed to himself—was that object<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_402" id="Page_402">[402]</a></span>
well secured? How well Aleph carried himself when
thrown on his own resources for guidance we have seen;
and my belief is that when his parents come to see him
and to hear the report of Cimon, they will be quite satisfied
with their experiment. They will realize that the
promising bud has beautifully flowered, that the rare
plant which had started and grown so thriftily in their
sheltered and sunny conservatory was now hardy enough
to be transplanted into the open field, and even to the
windy summits of life.</p>

<p>So all the ends proposed in the visit of our friends to
Alexandria were accomplished—and more. For these
unknown men had been the means of introducing not
only a loftier moral element into the student life of Alexandria,
but had so drawn upon Cornelius and Metellus,
who had specially attached themselves to them, that they
had begun to study the Septuagint, to frequent the services
at the Diapleuston, to admire the sublime monotheism
and hopes of the Jew, and finally to give sure
token of becoming, the one the devout Cornelius of the
Acts of the Apostle and the other one of those Christians
saluted by Paul as belonging to “Aristobulus’ household.”</p>

<p>But the influence of Aleph on Sextus Flaccus was still
more remarkable. His frequent interviews with that
penitent man ended not only in his thorough reform,
and in his renouncing idolatry, but also in his accepting
Jesus as a Divine sacrifice for sin.</p>

<p>And it was on this wise. The young Roman at first
was terribly oppressed with a sense of sin. He could
hardly say too much against himself. His misdeeds and
follies haunted him like ghosts, and hunted him like<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_403" id="Page_403">[403]</a></span>
the Eumenides. Their horrible faces scowled at him,
their serpent-hair hissed and leaped at him, their
clenched hands shook themselves at him from behind
almost every object he saw. Sometimes in his sleep
he would see a mountain, traced all over in fiery characters
with the names of his sins, moving swiftly toward
him; and he would wake drenched in sweat and
terror as the ponderous masses came rushing in upon
him and buried him thousands of feet beneath their munitions
of rocks. At other times he dreamed that, like
Andromeda, he was chained to a rock at the ocean’s edge,
and that great storm-billows in long succession were
sweeping in upon him, and that on the crested summit of
each a great sea-monster with lurid eyes and open jaws
came rushing and shrieking <em>Sin</em>, <em class="smcap">Sin, SIN</em>. He
shrieked as loudly—and awoke in despair.</p>

<p>It was in this state that he first sent for Aleph. His
first sense of relief came when Aleph told him the story
of Jesus, and suggested the idea of a Divine incarnation
and atonement for sin. The wretched man clutched the
idea as a drowning man does a plank. Here was something
solid to rest upon. Here was a sufficient sacrifice
for even his enormities. The weight began to lift from
his oppressed breast. At last one day as Aleph was reading
to him the sublime description which Isaiah gives in
his 53d chapter of Him on whom “were laid the iniquities
of us all,” a mighty deliverance came. Suddenly all
his doors and windows sprang open musically to welcome
Jesus as the Lamb of God. The sense of need opened
them. From that day the sick body mended wonderfully;
and soon the streets of Alexandria saw a new man
under an old name. The name continued to be Sextus<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_404" id="Page_404">[404]</a></span>
Flaccus, but it stood for a very different person. It stood
for the first Roman Christian of rank who dared to avow
himself. Paul on his arrival at Rome some years later
found him a member of Cæsar’s household, and ready to
help him with all his influence in founding the first Roman
church.</p>

<p>This was a great and unexpected success. But, in addition,
our eastern pilgrims, with nothing but their cultured
manhood to show, had found other friends such as
they had never counted on finding—friends well worth
the having, even by a prince; friends whose friendship
was for themselves and not for their rank; friends among
whom was one—but I must not anticipate. Nay, I must
go back a little.</p>

<p>Though Alexander had reached home early in the
evening before the last trial, it was very late before he
could get to his rest—he had so much to tell and so much
to hear. And this was what he had to tell. He had succeeded
in both the objects for which he had hastened to
Rome. Of course, one of these objects was to prevent
the disturbance at the Diapleuston from being misrepresented
to the emperor as a personal affront. It was not
reported at all. For some reason Flaccus had not
thought it best to say anything about the matter in his
dispatches. Probably he thought that some of the circumstances
would not bear telling; and then the presence
of Alexander at the ear of the emperor was in itself
a caution to be prudent. So Flaccus was dumb.</p>

<p>The other object which Alexander had in view was
really to find out some safe way of declining the marriage
proposals in behalf of the Cæsar.</p>

<p>Notwithstanding the fears of his daughter, he had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_405" id="Page_405">[405]</a></span>
never been so much attracted by the offer of an imperial
alliance as were some of his Jewish friends. He had
been too much behind the scenes at the Palatine. He
knew too much of Tiberius and Cæsarism. He knew
nothing to the disadvantage of Germanicus and much to
his advantage; but he also knew that Tiberius as a young
man had won golden opinions; also, that to be the
nephew and heir apparent of the jealous and capricious
emperor was very far from being foreordained to empire.
So one of his objects in going to Rome was, not to see
whether the proposals were desirable, but to see how they
might safely be declined. That was a hard problem.
But Providence favored him. He found that Germanicus,
who had never seen Rachel, had many times seen
Agrippina, the granddaughter of Augustus, and to very
good purpose. The growing intimacy and attachment
between the young people which he was not slow to discover
he promoted to the utmost. And when the matter
was ripe he found means of bringing it to the knowledge
of Sejanus, the emperor’s favorite, and of so enlisting
him in its support that under his influence Tiberius began
to regret his Egyptian proposals, and to seek some excuse
for recalling them. “He did not know, when they were
made, of the situation at home. It had only just come
to his knowledge. He was sorry; but he hated to break
young hearts.” Alexander allowed that it would be a
pity. The emperor also thought that, inasmuch as Germanicus
and Rachel had never met, it might not, after
all, be a very hard matter for the fair Alexandrian to have
the matter dropped in such a quiet and honorable way as
could easily be devised. Alexander candidly allowed
that the fact which his majesty had stated was a weighty<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_406" id="Page_406">[406]</a></span>
one. In short, Tiberius receded from his proposals;
and, to soften the supposed disappointment to the mighty
banker for whom his treasury had so much use, he sent
him home in the imperial galley with new guaranties and
privileges for the Jewish community in Egypt, and with
a broad hint to Flaccus to let it be known that the honor
of the imperial alliance had been declined from religious
considerations which the emperor felt bound to respect.
The Alabarch expected nothing less than that early the
next morning all Alexandria would be in possession of the
news, and would be wondering how he could so rebuff
the emperor and yet stand higher in his favor than ever.</p>

<p>This, for substance, was what Alexander had to tell.
Of course Rachel was vastly delighted at her escape; and
showed that she was by flinging her arms about her
father’s neck and rapturously kissing him.</p>

<p>But the father wanted to hear as well as to tell.
Something of what had transpired had reached him by
letter; but he wanted to know all. And Seti rehearsed
all that had happened since that memorable Sabbath at
the Diapleuston. Rachel sat uneasily silent, leaning
against her father and toying with the splendid jewelled
badge of the Order of the Golden Eagle which Tiberius
at parting had, with his own hands, fastened on his
breast—listening with burning cheeks as her grandfather
in his graphic way reproduced the events and expressed
the confidence and admiration with which Aleph had inspired
him. Every now and then she stole an anxious
look at her father’s face; not quite sure how the shrewd
man of affairs, professionally accustomed to deal with
men on a principle of suspicion and abundant caution,
would view the eulogiums of the priest and philosopher,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_407" id="Page_407">[407]</a></span>
founded on so brief an acquaintance. When Alexander
had heard all, he said slowly:</p>

<p>“If I had never seen the young man, nor known Seti
so well, I might have challenged the sobriety of the account
I have just heard. But, having seen him twice,
and you a thousand times, I have nothing to say, save
that I wish he was emperor of the West, or at least the
Cæsar. In that case, perhaps, I would not take so much
trouble to keep the Cæsar at arm’s-length, as I have been
lately taking in another quarter”—and he nodded smilingly
at Rachel. “But who can he be?”</p>

<p>“No matter who he is,” returned Seti with emphasis,
“since he is a <em>Man</em>, a sovereign man. He has a broader
empire within him than Tiberius sees without him; an
empire of which no caprice of fortune can rob him. And
his body is as sovereign as his soul. He needs no herald
to go before him and cry, <i>Make way, for the king is coming</i>.
Men know it as soon as they see him.”</p>

<p>To such words Rachel could have listened all night.
But she wondered whether they would have been spoken
had father and grandfather known what she knew. She
had not yet mustered courage to speak to Seti of her new
relation to Aleph; in fact had about made up her mind
to leave all explanations to Providence and Aleph. So
both Seti and Alexander remained ignorant of that wonderful
conversation between the young people which I
have lately recorded till Aleph the Chaldean had become
Aleph the Prince, and had asked leave to substitute
for the proposals of Tiberius certain proposals of his
own. Then the whole matter came out. The Alabarch
found that his daughter had no serious objection to being
a princess provided the prince was of the right sort. He<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_408" id="Page_408">[408]</a></span>
was in very much the same mood himself. Indeed, he
went so far as to say that he would not have refused his
daughter to Aleph had he always remained simply Aleph
the Chaldean, of unknown birth and fortunes: how much
less could he do it now that the young man stood revealed
a Hebrew of the Hebrews, a descendant of Daniel
the illustrious statesman and prophet, and the heir of the
stablest and choicest, though not the largest, sovereignty
of the age!</p>

<p>So, before many days (but not until the arrival of
Rachel’s mother from Jerusalem, and her express sanction,
and even her joyful confession that Aleph was a
very welcome substitute for even so good a Cæsar as Germanicus)
a formal betrothal took place; and all Alexandria
took to busily talking over the gracious ceremonial.
Now they understood why Germanicus had been respectfully
declined. The ground had been pre-empted. Another
prince had spoken, and spoken in person. “And
no wonder,” said they, “that he was successful; for
never did we set eyes on a goodlier person or a princelier.”
So Alexandria was in excellent humor; and for
once all the five quarters of the city ceased their mutual
wrangling and railing and consented to say the same
complimentary things. Even the elders of the Diapleuston
who so much wanted to see a second Esther on the
imperial throne were by this time ready to allow that
Rachel had chosen very happily for herself, if not for the
Jewish public. They offered congratulations. They
sent in rich presents—especially Ben Simeon, who, from
the first, had been so drawn to Aleph, and was now in
charge as consignee in the place of Malus. But the richest
and most valued presents that Rachel received on that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_409" id="Page_409">[409]</a></span>
auspicious day were two—from opposite quarters. One
was a copy from the Septuagint of all the Messianic
prophecies in their order, beautifully done on vellum
margined with jewels—this came from Aleph. The
other came from Flaccus, in the name of his son Sextus,
and was no less than the Setian palace on the Nile which
has had so conspicuous a place in this narrative. Some
damage had been done to it by Draco and his band in
their orgies and final rummage for concealed treasure:
but he had been so thoroughly frightened by what he
had done to Sextus, as well as by the escape of Aleph and
the numerous foot-prints found about the premises early
the next morning, that his search was very hasty and
ended in the whole gang betaking themselves precipitately
to the desert—to the great misfortune of the desert and
travelers, but without much damage to the stronghold
they had left. It was soon put in prime condition by
Flaccus, and then, in an elaborate communication, presented
to Seti for Rachel and Aleph as an “Egyptian
home to which his excellency hoped they would very
often return.” It was a question in the mind of Seti
whether a man could give what does not belong to him;
but this question, wise man that he was, he kept to himself,
and was very glad to have the ancient heirloom come
back in any way into his family.</p>

<p>And these were the ulterior arrangements. Cimon
and Aleph would return home at once by way of Palestine,
with the hope of falling in with the Messiah ere his return
heavenward. Then, as soon as possible, Aleph
would come again with his father’s formal sanction to
claim his bride; and then her father and mother and dear
mother-father would take a long vacation and accompany<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_410" id="Page_410">[410]</a></span>
her and Miriam (henceforth inseparable) to their new
home. Alexander even went so far as to intimate that,
mindful of the uncertainty of the imperial favor and of
the Jewish position in Alexandria, he was thinking seriously
of transferring the bulk of his fortune to a safer
region; and to facilitate this had already arranged to
open a branch banking house at Ecbatana, where converged
many routes of commercial travel. By all means
do this, O great financier, and tarry not in the doing;
for the times in the west are threatening, and Rome is a
volcano that may at any moment send streams of lava
farther than Alexandria. Plant thy family and fortunes
amid the safe Chaldean mountains, hard by the tombs of
Daniel and Esther in Eden; and, looking calmly forth
from your impregnable observatory, see distant Cæsars
rise and fall, see distant legions march and counter-march,
and, above all, see the friendly star that offers to
guide your faith and gifts to Jesus the King. Then
push out the antennæ of commerce vigorously into all
lands, and gather the spoils of peace wherewith to decorate
the Prince of peace. It is your mission. You have
a genius for honorable money-making. Use it vigorously.
It is as sacred as a genius for eloquence, or a
genius for science.</p>

<p class="tb">A brilliant caravan files through the gate of Canopus.
Our friends are moving homeward. They came by the
way the Magian fathers returned; they are returning by
the way those fathers came. They have just said farewells
to Shaphan and Nathan: a little before they had
said still more tender ones at the palace of Alexander.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_411" id="Page_411">[411]</a></span>
Flaccus had insisted on sending with them an escort of
cavalry as far as the frontier; and Alexander, and Seti,
and Cornelius at the head of a large delegation from the
University, will go with them a day’s journey.</p>

<p><em>We</em> will not go with them even that distance, though
we would be glad to do so; but will say our farewells and
godspeeds just here before the khan where Shaphan and
Nathan once reluctantly parted with the Divine Child.
Our parting, too, is reluctant. We are vastly sorry, O
wise men of the East, to say good-bye to you, though it
be for only a few moons. It is not often that such as
you have crossed our path, or any path. But partings
must be; and so, comforting ourselves with the expectation
of seeing you again when all Alexandria is ablaze
with that rare thing, a royal marriage made in Heaven,
we gather courage to say <span class="smcap">Adieu</span>! May the Father above
prosper your way to the father below. We foresee that
He will. You and yours are well mounted; and though
only Aleph has a Parthia beneath him, there can be but a
few days of travel between you and the Messiah. The
longings of your hearts will be gratified. You will reach
Galilee in season. There, on a certain mountain, with
more than five hundred fellow disciples, you will see with
your own eyes Him in whom you have blessedly believed
without seeing; will be welcomed by Him for the fathers’
sake as well as for your own; will perhaps see some of
the “many other signs which are not written in this
book”; and, finally, in the early morning, as you resume
your journey and are taking a look backward on
the city of so many sacred memories, you will see over
the Mount of Olives a human form slowly rising through
the air with outstretched hands of benediction. The son<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_412" id="Page_412">[412]</a></span>
of Daniel will need no interpreter. Behold the Heavenly
King going to his home even as you are going to yours!
And you will worship and go on your way rejoicing;
bearing to your Chaldean home such news that all its silver
trumpets will sound as it exclaims:</p>
